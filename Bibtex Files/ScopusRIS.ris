TI  - Orchestrating trajectory, active jamming, and antenna selection for energy-efficient secure aerial IRS communications
AU  - Wang, Tong
T2  - Vehicular Communications
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) offer a transformative approach to enhancing wireless connectivity and coverage. This paper tackles the critical challenge of maximizing energy efficiency (EE) in such a system while guaranteeing physical layer security. We consider a network where a multi-antenna base station (BS), assisted by a UAV-mounted IRS, serves multiple ground users (GUs) in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. To proactively secure transmissions, the BS simultaneously transmits artificial noise (AN) to degrade the eavesdroppers’ channels. We propose a holistic framework to maximize the overall system EE. Our approach orchestrates a comprehensive set of variables: the UAV's 3D trajectory, the BS's information and jamming beamforming, the dynamic selection of active transmit antennas at the BS, and the passive phase shifts of the IRS. This joint optimization is formulated under constraints for the GUs’ minimum secure Quality of Service (QoS), the BS's total transmit power budget, and the UAV's kinematic limits. The resulting problem is a highly complex, non-convex fractional program with coupled continuous and binary variables. To find a tractable solution, we design a multi-stage iterative algorithm that employs the Dinkelbach method and a Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) framework. Within each BCD iteration, the non-convex subproblems are solved using advanced techniques, including Semidefinite Relaxation (SDR), Successive Convex Approximation (SCA), and the Big-M method. Simulation results demonstrate that our orchestrated scheme significantly outperforms various benchmarks, providing crucial insights into the synergistic benefits of jointly designing active jamming and dynamic antenna selection for secure and energy-efficient aerial networks. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed in critical applications such as public safety, logistics, and infrastructure monitoring. As their autonomy grows through Machine Learning (ML) model integration, new challenges emerge related to security, reliability, and model interpretability. Cyberattacks such as GPS spoofing and jamming can compromise UAV navigation systems, while ML models often operate as opaque black boxes, limiting operator trust in high-stakes environments. This paper proposes a diagnostic framework based on the SafeML technique to enhance the trustworthiness of ML-driven UAVs. SafeML applies statistical monitoring using the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) and Wasserstein Distance to detect Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data and quantify prediction reliability at runtime. The study evaluates multiple ML models, including Random Forest (RF), LightGBM, and XGBoost, on a UAV dataset featuring real-world GPS spoofing and jamming scenarios. Experimental results show that the best models achieve accuracies above 98%, with SafeML effectively identifying low-confidence predictions that correlate with classification errors. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.

AB  - The primary challenge in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm operations against radars lies in the effective assessment of radar threat and the joint optimization of path planning and jamming resource allocation. To address this, a unified model is proposed, integrating radar threat assessment using the Grey-TOPSIS method with a one-dimensional real-coded scheme that combines continuous path parameters and discrete jamming variables. This encoding enables efficient co-optimization through an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), which integrates the perturbation mechanism of differential evolution (DE) and adaptive parameters adjustment mechanism. Inspired by the “runway-based suppression strategy”, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a 96.70 % survival rate for the fighter aircraft, successfully constructing a secure corridor under dynamic battlefield conditions. Furthermore, comparative experiment validates that the improved PSO outperforms other algorithms by achieving a balance among stability, time efficiency, and high convergence speed. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The design and adjustment of a twin-engine aircraft with flight weight of 11.5 kg, capable of carrying a payload of up to 3 kg over a distance of 70–80 km, based on the Pixhawk 6C flight controller using the Arduplane ver.4.3.7 firmware was carried out. The experimental adjustment of the firmware parameters for a given UAV geometry, its weight, and propeller-motor group was performed, ensuring a stable flight when performing an automatic mission. The parameters of the aircraft’s automatic takeoff for a mission flight were set. Despite the relatively large weight of the aircraft (up to 11.5 kg), its launch is configured by hand in automatic mode by one person without using a catapult. The designed aircraft is configured in the advanced fault-tolerant configuration (AFC) mode that is able to ensure the return of the aircraft to the launch point in the conditions of electronic jamming systems (EJS). According to this mode, if communication with satellites is lost, the aircraft stops follo-wing the planned mission and switches to a backup flight trajectory, which is able to take it out of the EJS zone. In this case, the simplified route is performed using the inertial system until the satellite communication is restored. The efficiency of using two-band GPS receivers with the installation of antenna screens to counteract electronic countermeasures is experimentally demonstrated, even in conditions of their close location to a flying drone. The paper considers different types of three-band antennas, including ceramic, helical with a screen, and helical antenna arrays. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.

AB  - In the context of smart city construction, the automatic monitoring of urban power grids using wireless sensor networks has become a hot research and application focus. When transmitting signals, these networks typically convey only simple data due to distance limitations and signal interference. Consequently, in recent years, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) have been employed to periodically gather detailed information generated by sensor network nodes. This study initially establishes a model for the wireless sensor network and employs a greedy algorithm to cluster signal nodes for forming UAV signal coverage zones. Utilizing index arrays for multi-point crossover expands the search space, while adaptive mutation and crossover operators are introduced to avert getting trapped in local optima. An improvement to the NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) algorithm, named NSGAP (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm Plus), is developed herein. Through simulation experiments, the NSGAP algorithm is applied to scenarios of varying inspection scales and compared with other conventional algorithms. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that the refined NSGAP algorithm outperforms others, effectively addressing the issue of efficiency in urban power grid inspection. © 2025, ICIC International.

T2  - Robotics and Autonomous Systems
AB  - The rise of unlawful and unauthorized operations of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has led to the need for versatile counter-drone systems. In this work, an autonomous counter-drone system is developed (denoted as RPS-JS-DNN — relative positioning and simultaneous jamming system with deep neural network learning), where a pursuer drone employs algorithms for detection, tracking, and jamming a rogue drone in real-time. The proposed system incorporates wireless interception capabilities to jam the rogue drone, together with self-positioning for the pursuer drone by employing a relative positioning system methodology based on signals of opportunity fused with inertial measurements. The performance of the proposed system depends on the switching between the jamming and self-localization modules, essentially leading to a jamming duration and positioning accuracy trade-off. The overall objective is the maximization of the jamming module's operation time, while also increasing the performance of the self-localization module. In the proposed system, a software-defined radio (SDR) is utilized, facilitating jamming and spectrum sweeping capabilities to realize the desired GPS disturbance and self-localization, respectively. A prototype system is developed, implemented, deployed, and tested over extensive field experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness to jam a rogue drone and also achieve relative navigation in a real-world environment under various parameter settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - Applied Mathematical Modelling
AB  - In the military field, the utilization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) formations to carry out saturation attacks on enemy forces is the development trend of future war. Traditional path planning algorithms have the disadvantages of poor real-time performance, poor flexibility, poor scalability, and weak anti-jamming ability, which make these algorithms difficult to apply in the control of large-scale joint non-uniform military UAV formations. This paper proposes a path-planning method for large-scale, low-cost military UAVs, it addresses three key aspects: system design, path-planning algorithms, and UAV safety guarantee. In system design, we implement a distributed formation control system. In this setup, individual agents can perform flight tasks independently using autonomous algorithms without needing to communicate with a central control center. In path planning algorithms, we quantify the four interactions of UAVs and combine them with the linear separation force strategy to construct a set of behavior-based formation coordination control methods through a reasonable interaction combination method. By adding guided paths, based on the integration of behavior-based formation coordination control methods, this paper retains the advantages of global path planning algorithms, such as high success rate, and local path planning algorithms, such as real-time performance. By designing a distributed formation control system with strong robustness and incorporating an escape mechanism, the system benefits from both passive and active fault-tolerant control strategies. This significantly enhances the overall stability of the system. Ablation experiments demonstrate that the components of the formation control system proposed in this paper are reasonable. Simulation experiments indicate that the distributed large-scale joint non-uniform UAV formation real-time path planning method is secure, stable, adaptable to various planning environments, and exhibits a fast convergence speed for the formation. Additionally, it is scalable, flexible, and suitable for application in large-scale clusters, among other benefits. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Today, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are heavily dependent on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) for positioning and navigation. However, GNSS signals are vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks. This poses serious security risks, especially for military operations and critical civilian missions. In order to solve this problem, an image-based geolocation system has been developed that eliminates GNSS dependency. The proposed system estimates the geographical location of the UAV by matching the aerial images taken by the UAV with previously georeferenced high-resolution satellite images. For this purpose, common visual features were determined between satellite and UAV images and matching operations were carried out using methods based on the homography matrix. Thanks to image processing, a significant relationship has been established between the area where the UAV is located and the geographical coordinates, and reliable positioning is ensured even in cases where GNSS signals cannot be used. Within the scope of the study, traditional methods such as SIFT, AKAZE, and Multiple Template Matching were compared with learning-based methods including SuperPoint, SuperGlue, and LoFTR. The results showed that deep learning-based approaches can make successful matches, especially at high altitudes. © 2025 by the authors.

TI  - An Overview of Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning for an Autonomous Multi-UAV Wireless Network
AU  - Sharma, Vikash Chandra

T2  - Expert Systems
AB  - In various fields, including environmental monitoring, communication, surveillance, and disaster response, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly essential. Autonomous multi-UAV wireless networks (MUWNs), where multiple UAVs work together, offer powerful solutions in these fields. However, making these networks fully autonomous is challenging, especially concerning real-time decision-making, coordination, and resource management. In the field of literature, there is a demand for a comprehensive survey of recent developments in Q-learning (QL) and deep Q-learning (DQL) within MUWNs. To address this gap, we provide a thorough evaluation of QL and DQL approaches, focusing on their application in autonomous MUWNs. We highlight their roles in route planning, communication relays, and network optimization, discussing advantages and limitations. The survey also explores key challenges, including scalability, energy efficiency, and real-time adaptability, and reviews how QL/DQL enhancements address them. In particular, this paper provides an overview of some QL and DQL applications in MUWNs, such as data retrieval, monitoring, aggregation, resource allocation, and task scheduling to support wireless connectivity, UAV-assisted autonomous trajectory planning, navigation, security, and jamming avoidance. The use of these technologies enables the effective use of UAVs in smart cities, monitoring of industrial complexes, agricultural surveys, and border security. Additionally, using the knowledge gathered from our review, we identify and discuss several open challenges. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) aims to revolutionize transportation by enabling on-demand, low-altitude movement of people and goods using Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL)-capable vehicles (VCAs), but achieving precise and reliable navigation remains a key challenge. The navigation of UAVs typically relies on the integration of GNSS and IMU measurements. When GNSS positioning is degraded or unavailable due to factors such as jamming, spoofing, and multipath effects, these approaches become unreliable. Perception-based methods, such as SLAM based on a combination of RGB camera, event camera, LiDAR, and IMU can lead to resilient navigation with loop closure for drift correction. However, loop closure is often impractical for a point-to point AAM flight. To tackle these challenges, this ongoing research work proposes a multi-modal navigation framework that integrates map-based navigation and semantic SLAM. For the development of this framework, we designed a conceptual setup, which will be presented in this paper. Additionally, we focus on the selection of sensors, their spatio-temporal calibration, and their integration into a holistic onboard system. © Author(s) 2025. CC BY 4.0 License.

AB  - The reduction of synthetic pesticide use is an urgent priority due to their adverse impacts on human health, non-target organisms, and ecosystems. Entomophagous biological control offers an effective and environmentally benign alternative, but its large-scale adoption is constrained by labor-intensive release methods and the inaccessibility of flood-prone or obstructed terrain. Overcoming these technological barriers is essential for advancing sustainable crop protection. In this study, we designed, prototyped, and tested an automated UAV-based system for the aerial release of Trichogramma spp. encapsulated in biodegradable carriers. The device was developed through rapid prototyping with 3D modeling, additive manufacturing, and Raspberry Pi–driven GPS/GLONASS navigation integrated with a web-based control interface. Laboratory emergence assays confirmed 100% parasitoid emergence within six hours at 30 °C and within 24 hours at 25 °C, demonstrating that encapsulation and aerial release did not compromise biological viability. Field trials showed release accuracy within ±1 meter and identified three meters as the optimal drop height to minimize wind drift and rotor-induced turbulence. Capsule jamming, initially observed in 10% of releases, was reduced to isolated cases following mechanical refinements. Economic assessment revealed that capsules can be produced at a cost of 31.75–36.25 KZT per unit, with designs optimized for stackability, low weight, and complete biodegradability.

AB  - Highlights: What are the main findings? Developed a safety-aware pre-flight trajectory planner that incorporates contingency plans for mechanical failures, GPS denial/spoofing, and communication loss. Demonstrated that modest increases in trajectory length can significantly improve safety by ensuring feasible emergency landings and robust operations in urban environments. What is the implication of the main finding? Enhances the reliability of UAV operations under real-world failure scenarios, supporting safe integration of drones into urban airspace. Provides a framework aligned with regulatory safety guidelines (FAA, EASA, CASA) that can inform the design of future Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) systems. Urban drone operations are exposed to unpredictable risks, including engine failure and deliberate signal interference. A recent and ongoing disruption in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, has seen widespread GPS spoofing that misleads devices by hundreds of kilometers, illustrating how fragile unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations can become when over-reliant on GNSS-based navigation. Such disruptions highlight the urgent need for contingency planning in drone traffic management systems. This study introduces a safety-aware pre-flight path planning framework that proactively integrates emergency landing and GPS fallback options into UAV trajectory pre-flight planning. The planner considers proximity to predesignated emergency landing zones, communication coverage, and airspace restrictions, enabling UAVs to safely complete their operations. The approach is evaluated across realistic mission profiles such as delivery, inspection, and surveillance. Results show that the planner successfully maintains mission feasibility while embedding emergency readiness throughout each flight. This work contributes toward safer, failure-resilient drone integration in urban airspace, ensuring that contingency plans are proactively incorporated into path planning before the failure even occurs. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - A wide range of research has been conducted on path planning and collision avoidance to enhance the operational efficiency of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The existing works have mainly assumed an environment with static obstacles and global positioning system (GPS) signals. However, practical environments have often been involved with dynamic obstacles, dense areas with numerous obstacles in confined spaces, and blocked GPS signals. In order to consider these issues for practical implementation, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based method is proposed for path planning and collision avoidance in GPS-denied and dense environments. In the proposed method, robust path planning and collision avoidance can be conducted by using the received signal strength (RSS) value with the extended Kalman filter (EKF). Additionally, the attitude of the UAV is adopted as part of the action space to enable the generation of smooth trajectories. Performance was evaluated under single- and multi-target scenarios with numerous dynamic obstacles. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method can generate smoother trajectories and shorter path lengths while consistently maintaining a lower collision rate compared to conventional methods. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Due to the high flexibility of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), equipping Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers on UAVs can effectively and rapidly handle the high computing requirements of computation-intensive tasks. However, the Line-of-Sight (LoS) transmission between the UAV and ground users makes the offloading information be easily monitored. Therefore, this paper proposes a covert communication scheme against a flying warden in UAV-assisted MEC system. In the proposed scheme, the UAV server assists ground users in completing the computation of offloading tasks. To reduce the possibility of the flying warden detecting the transmission behavior of ground users to the UAV server, a ground jamming device sends jamming signals to the flying warden. The minimum computing capacity of the system is maximized by jointly optimizing ground users’ resources and the UAV server's trajectory under the constraint of system covertness. Due to the multivariable coupling, the optimization problem is non-convex. The optimization problem is first transformed into a tractable form, and then the optimizing solution is iteratively obtained using Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) and Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) algorithms. Numerical results show that, compared to the benchmark schemes, the proposed scheme effectively enhances the computing capacity of the system while meeting the system's covertness requirements. © 2025 The Author(s)

AB  - The application of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in complex urban environments has demonstrated significant potential for emergency response, infrastructure inspection, and urban environmental monitoring. However, path planning for multi-UAV systems in such environments remains particularly challenging due to the presence of various threat zones, including obstacles, signal interference regions, and hazardous areas, which existing methods fail to address adequately. We present an enhanced grid-based modeling approach specifically designed for urban environments with distinct threat zones to bridge this gap. In addition, we propose an improved Multi-UAV Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star (RRT*) algorithm integrated with Biased Sampling, Candidate Evaluation and Path Reconfiguration techniques (MU-RRT*-BCR). Specifically, the combination of biased sampling and candidate evaluation enhances node selection, reducing the average objective function value by 16.66% and CPU time by 80.28% compared to MU-RRT*. Additionally, a security detection mechanism is incorporated to prevent inter-UAV collisions. Moreover, a path reconfiguration technique is employed to refine the UAV trajectories, while the Dubins method is applied to ensure that the planned paths satisfy UAV kinematic constraints. Overall, extensive comparative studies validate our algorithm against several RRT* variants and A* algorithms. Compared to MU-RRT*, the proposed method reduces the average objective function value by 17.59% and CPU time by 81.26% while achieving 4.86% and 65.91% reductions, respectively, compared to A*. Furthermore, A practical case study based on Changsha's skyline illustrates the method's robustness and analyzes key factors impacting planning. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The article presents the concept and architecture of digital twins (DT) in the tasks of autonomous swarm navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) controlled by artificial intelligence. Study demonstrated that the effective operation of a drone swarm under conditions of disrupted or absent communication with the ground center is enabled by the functional distribution of DT components between the ground center and onboard levels of AI agents. Mathematical models of ground center’s DT provide strategic modeling, training, mission simulation, and post-mission analysis, while onboard AI agents focus on local adaptation, diagnostics, environmental reconstruction, and cognitive behavior control. Special attention is paid to the interface module of the DT, which provides asynchronous interaction with the ground infrastructure. A functional division on the swarm-level, environment, mission, telemetry, and agent-level DTs is proposed. The effectiveness of the “Learn–Simulate–Deploy–Adapt” cycle for continuous improvement of swarm systems in the context of electronic warfare (EW) and dynamic operational environments was justified.

TI  - BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SECURE COMMUNICATION FOR UAV NETWORKS: A DECENTRALIZED APPROACH TO GNSS SPOOFING DETECTION
AU  - Draugelytė, Paulina

T2  - Aviation
AB  - Ensuring secure communication in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks is a critical challenge due to vulnerabilities such as GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) spoofing, jamming, and unauthorized data manipulation. This research investigates the feasibility of blockchain technology as a decentralized and immutable framework for enhancing UAV communication security. A blockchain-based GNSS spoofing detection system is designed, implemented, and validated within a simulated environment integrating AirSim, Ethereum blockchain (Ganache), smart contract (Solidity), and Python-based UAV simulations. The proposed system employs a consensus mechanism among UAVs to detect anomalous GNSS data and mitigate spoofing attacks in real-time. Performance evaluation metrics – transaction latency, blockchain throughput, gas consumption, detection accuracy, storage usage, and energy consumption – demonstrate the system’s capability to securely validate UAV location data. Findings indicate that blockchain ensures data integrity and resilience against cyber threats, though challenges related to transaction latency, scalability and computational overhead persist. The study contributes to the field of aerospace cybersecurity and IoT-based UAV networks by proposing an innovative approach to autonomous, trustless UAV coordination. Future work will focus on optimizing the consensus mechanism and reducing blockchain resource consumption to enhance real-world applicability. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, UAVs are gaining increasing importance in civilian, industrial, and military applications. UAVs are used for environmental monitoring, medical deliveries, emergency response, and reconnaissance missions. However, their widespread use also introduces new security challenges, driving the advancement of counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UASs). This paper provides a comprehensive review of intentional interference techniques targeting the radio links between UAVs and ground control stations, as well as global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals, which are essential for autonomous and remote-controlled UAV one operations. The paper examines the radio frequency spectrum utilized by UAVs and characterizes their typical radio emissions. It presents a detailed classification of jamming methods, ranging from conventional noise jamming to advanced intelligent jamming and spoofing techniques. Furthermore, it explores a wide range of spoofing attacks against GNSS receivers, including replay attacks, signal forgery, estimation-based spoofing, and cooperative advanced methods. Each technique is analyzed in terms of implementation complexity and operational effectiveness. In addition, the paper highlights commercial C-UAS solutions, showcasing practical approaches to UAV mitigation through targeted signal disruption. This review offers an in-depth overview of current threats and defense technologies, serving as a foundation for future research on adaptive and selective UAV neutralization methods. © 2025, Faculty of Navigation, Gdynia Maritime University.

AB  - High-performance positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) service is critical to the safe flight of low-altitude aircraft and the effective management of low altitude traffic. In low-altitude economic scenarios, the specificity of massive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights and the complexity of low-altitude airspace traffic management impose stringent demand on the high-continuity, high-accuracy, real-time, and high-security PNT service. However, the current PNT service, which primarily relies on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Micro-Electro-Mechanical System Inertial Navigation System (MEMS INS), etc., is completely inadequate to support the future needs of low-altitude economic development. In order to bridge the huge gap between existing capability and future demand, a three-layer PNT architecture based on the collaboration of space-based, air-based and ground- based PNT systems is proposed for low-altitude economy. The space-based layer consists of high, medium even possible low orbit GNSS constellations, such as BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), for high- precision, high-security absolute positioning and timing. The air-based layer leverages inter-aircraft links for high-reliability dynamic relative positioning. The ground-based layer includes pseudolite network, as well as 5G-advanced (5G-A)/6G network, for more comprehensive coverage and real-time positioning. To this end, it is imperative to make breakthroughs in key technologies, from systems to airborne terminal, including but not limited to high-precision anti-jamming GNSS signal processing, high-reliability relative positioning, real-time pseudolite positioning, and high-efficient multi-source information fusion at airborne terminal, etc. Due to the moderate redundancy, heterogeneous mechanism, and multiple coverage from multiple PNT systems, the proposed layered PNT architecture possesses high robustness and resilient. Additionally, the integration of INS, LiDAR and vision etc. perception technologies can significantly enhance the PNT capability. As a result, the proposed three-layer PNT architecture enable greater autonomy for low- altitude aircraft and intelligent traffic management for massive UAV operations, and promoting the safe and efficient development of the low-altitude economy. © 2013 China Institute of Communications.

AB  - The safety-critical functions of autonomous drones heavily rely on Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) information provided by Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSSs). This makes GNSS technology a critical element as the PNT solution can be affected by several threats, mostly in urban and suburban environments. In order to evaluate safe and reliable GNSS-based solutions in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) scenarios, a proper GNSS security impact simulator is needed. In this context, the present work details the design, implementation and testing of a GNSS Threat Simulator (GTS) capable of reproducing typical issues within a GNSS system in a UAM environment, such as satellite visibility (i.e., the actual visibility condition of the receiver’s antenna with respect to terrain and ground obstacle), multipath, electromagnetic interference, cyber threats (i.e., spoofing and jamming) and satellites failures. The GTS elaborates and modifies dual-frequency multi-constellation GNSS observables in order to inject the desired threats. The effectiveness of the proposed simulator has been demonstrated through both fast-time and real-time simulations, in which the GTS was used to validate a hybrid navigation unit installed on a drone operating in a representative urban scenario. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents a simple and cost-effective anti-jamming method for global navigation satellite system (GNSS) antennas of an aerial drone. The drone has three GNSS antennas, such that two antennas exist at distinct heights inside a metallic shielding structure, and one antenna exists outside the shielding structure. To overcome intentional jamming signals from low elevation angles, we designed an autonomous antenna selection method. In the proposed antenna selection method, the most suitable GNSS antenna is dynamically selected to ensure stable satellite signal reception, while blocking the jamming signals from low elevation angles. Experiments were conducted to validate the proposed approach. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - This study examines the routing and scheduling of an integrated system of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) for maritime surveillance. The uncertainties in air and maritime conditions can cause delays in the movements of UAVs and USVs. We introduce a robust coordinated path planning approach for the UAV-USV system, optimizing operational efficiency while accounting for UAV/USV travel time unreliability. Specifically, we propose a novel robust compact formulation for the coordinated path planning problem using the budgeted uncertainty sets. To solve this complex problem, we decompose it into a master problem, i.e., a set partitioning problem, and a subproblem that deals with the robust resource-constrained elementary shortest paths. Furthermore, we propose a customized branch-and-price-and-cut solution algorithm to efficiently solve the robust path planning problem. Numerical studies illustrate that our approach can produce solutions that are significantly more robust than those that ignore uncertainty. © 2025

T2  - Vehicular Communications
AB  - The cognitive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system has emerged as a pivotal technology in addressing the scarcity of spectral resources for UAV communications, but the jamming and eavesdropping attacks are severe due to the high-quality air-to-ground communication links. Consequently, this paper introduces a UAV-enabled cooperative jammer to disrupt the eavesdropping activities of active eavesdroppers by emitting artificial noise. Our objective is to jointly optimize the three-dimensional UAV trajectory and transmit power to maximize the secrecy communication rate under quality of service (QoS) requirement. To tackle the non-convex problem, the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods are utilized to transform it into an approximate convex problem, and then we design an alternative optimization iterative algorithm to achieve suboptimal but efficient solution. Moreover, we extend the developed algorithm into an imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenario to maximize the worst-case secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the robust UAV's trajectory and transmit power, where the location uncertainties of ground primary, secondary, and eavesdropping devices are considered. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization algorithm significantly enhances system secrecy performance under different real-world settings compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Ensuring the resilient navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under conditions of limited or unstable sensor information is one of the key challenges of modern autonomous mobility within smart infrastructure and sustainable development. This article proposes an intelligent autonomous UAV control method based on the integration of geometric trajectory modeling, neural network-based sensor data filtering, and reinforcement learning. The geometric model, constructed using path coordinates, allows the trajectory tracking problem to be formalized as an affine control system, which ensures motion stability even in cases of partial data loss. To process noisy or fragmented GPS and IMU signals, an LSTM-based recurrent neural network filter is implemented. This significantly reduces positioning errors and maintains trajectory stability under environmental disturbances. In addition, the navigation system includes a reinforcement learning module that performs real-time obstacle prediction, path correction, and speed adaptation. The method has been tested in a simulated environment with limited sensor availability, variable velocity profiles, and dynamic obstacles. The results confirm the functionality and effectiveness of the proposed navigation system under sensor-deficient conditions. The approach is applicable to environmental monitoring, autonomous delivery, precision agriculture, and emergency response missions within smart regions. Its implementation contributes to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 9, SDG 11, and SDG 13) by enhancing autonomy, energy efficiency, and the safety of flight operations. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Accurate spatial distribution information of field features is critical for enabling autonomous agricultural machinery navigation. However, current perception systems exhibit limited segmentation performance in complex farm environments due to illumination variations and mutual occlusion among various regions. This paper proposes a low-cost UAV photogrammetry framework for centimeter-level 3D semantic maps of agricultural fields to support autonomous agricultural machinery path planning. The methodology combines UAV-captured images with RTK positioning to reconstruct high-precision 3D point clouds, followed by a novel Local-Global Feature Aggregation Network (LoGA-Net) integrating multi-scale attention mechanisms and geometric constraints. The framework achieves 78.6% mIoU in classifying eight critical agricultural categories: paddy field, dry field, building, vegetation, farm track, paved ground, infrastructure and other static obstacles. Experimental validation demonstrates a 5.9% accuracy improvement over RandLA-Net on the Semantic3D benchmark. This advancement significantly enhances perception accuracy in complex agricultural environments, particularly for field boundary delineation and occluded feature recognition, which directly facilitates robust path planning for unmanned agricultural machinery. The framework provides a scalable technical and data-driven foundation for achieving fully autonomous farm operations, ensuring both operational efficiency and environmental sustainability. © 2025

AB  - Traditional radio frequency (RF)-based anti-drone technologies focus on jamming the command and control (C2) RF signal or global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signal of a target drone. Although these methods efficiently neutralize target drones, they may generate unintended RF collisions with other equipment and cause the drone to crash. We introduce a method for hijacking a frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)-based drone through C2 signal emission for takeover and a precision spoofing signal to invalidate the owner's transmitter signal using a multi-modem in this work. The proposed method simultaneously transmits C2 signals to the target drone for safe takeover and precision spoofing signals to neutralize the owner's transmitter, thereby minimizing RF collisions with other equipment. 1225-6463/$ © 2025 ETRI.

TI  - Beamformer and trajectory optimization for security in UAV-assisted MEC systems
AU  - Shao, Lin
T2  - Telecommunication Systems
AB  - This paper is concerned with the optimization problem for dual unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mobile edge computing systems. One UAV acts as a computation server and the other is a jammer in the system, while the terminal device (TD) on the ground uploads its computation task to the UAV server with the presence of an eavesdropper. The design objective is to maximize the average secrecy rate of TD. Furthermore, the trajectories of UAVs, transmit beamformers, and computation bits are jointly optimized. As the formulated problem is non-convex, it is decomposed into two sub-problems. Then, we employ the successive convex approximation and alternative optimization method to solve the problem iteratively. Moreover, the zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming scheme is utilized for further simplification of calculation. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm is effective, and the proposed ZF scheme achieves close-to-optimal performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - This paper considers a mobile jammer-aided unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay communication system, where a relay UAV assists information transmission between the source node and the destination node, while a friendly jammer UAV emits an interference signal to the eavesdropper to suppress its eavesdropping behavior. The secure energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problem is studied. The objective is to maximize the SEE via jointly optimizing power and UAVs' trajectories. The formulated problem is non-convex and subject to information-causality constraints, power constraints, and mobility constraints, which cannot be solved directly by convex optimization tools. To solve the problem, the block coordinate descent method is applied to decouple the original problem into four sub-problems. Then, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to address the non-convex problem through the successive convex approximation technique. Additionally, Dinkelbach's algorithm is employed to handle the fractional programming problem, thereby obtaining an approximate solution with guaranteed convergence. Different schemes are evaluated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed design. The simulation results show that the proposed design can improve SEE effectively compared with other schemes. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - A Time-Delay-Based Forwarding UAV Deception Jamming Method
AU  - Zhou, Jiangping
AU  - Ding, Lili
AU  - Li, Jieqiong
AB  - Aiming at the hazards of UAV in the aspects of out-of-control accident and interference with air traffic control, a delay-based forwarding UAV deception jamming method is proposed. By controlling the delay stacking strategy of the forwarding jamming device, the deception position is constructed in real time, the UAV position is pulled off point by point, and the wrong navigation coordinate system is reconstructed to lure the target UAV to fly away from the sensitive area to protect the ground security. Drones are even lured to target areas for capture or shooting down. In this method, the whole UAV deception process is regarded as a time iterative process of single-step position deception pulling. First, the deception position is constructed according to the preset trajectory position and real position of the UAV, and then the optimal delay scheme is obtained through the delay algorithm. After superimposed on the original satellite signal, the position deception is realized through the forwarding jamming device. Finally, the UAV deviates from the preset path to the target area to realize the point-by-point offset deception of the UAV position. The simulation results show that the UAV spoofing method based on time delay can make the target UAV deviate from the original trajectory gradually without being detected, so as to achieve the purpose of satellite navigation spoofing. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The paper describes radio beacon systems and presents a mathematical solution for locating an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a direction-finding device. This system provides continuous flight and allows you to determine the exact coordinates of targets regardless of satellite signals. It enables the successful execution of combat missions in adverse weather conditions and when using radio electronic warfare systems based on signals received from radio beacons. Thus, due to the recent development of unmanned aerial vehicles, many countries are improving their radio electronic warfare systems. Because in a real war, destroying cheap UAVs with expensive Air Defensive Systems missiles does not benefit any country financially. Radio electronic warfare systems are being developed rapidly because they are more effective in this respect. Taking this into account, it is possible to increase the resistance against radio electronic warfare systems by developing the issue of integration of the beacon systems into the UAV proposed in the article. Thus, by setting up beacon systems, it is possible to perform a UAV flight during radio electronic warfare application in any conditions. © 2025, Gnedenko Forum. All rights reserved.

AB  - The dependency of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones, on off-board data, such as control and position data, makes them highly susceptible to serious safety and security threats, including data interceptions, Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming, and spoofing attacks. This indeed necessitates the existence of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in place to detect potential security threats/intrusions promptly. Recently, machine-learning-based IDSs have gained popularity due to their high performance in detecting known as well as novel cyber-attacks. However, the time and computation efficiencies of ML-based IDSs still present a challenge in the UAV domain. Therefore, this paper proposes a hybrid Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) technique based on feature importance ranking along with a Spearman Correlation Analysis (SCA). This technique is built on ensemble learning approaches, namely, bagging, boosting, stacking, and voting classifiers, to efficiently detect GPS spoofing attacks. Two benchmark datasets are employed: the GPS spoofing dataset and the UAV location GPS spoofing dataset. The results show that our proposed ensemble models achieved a notable balance between efficacy and efficiency, showing that the bagging classifier achieved the highest accuracy rate of 99.50%. At the same time, the Decision Tree (DT) and the bagging classifiers achieved the lowest processing time of 0.003 s and 0.029 s, respectively, using the GPS spoofing dataset. For the UAV location GPS spoofing dataset, the bagging classifier emerged as the top performer, achieving 99.16% accuracy and 0.002 s processing time compared to other well-known ML models. In addition, the experimental results show that our proposed methodology (RFE) outperformed other well-known ML models built on conventional feature selection techniques for detecting GPS spoofing attacks, such as mutual information gain, correlation matrices, and the chi-square test. © 2025 by the authors.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Navigation System for Automatic Landing Approach of Fixed-Wing UAVs in GNSS-Denied Environments
AU  - Lin, Ying Xi
AU  - Lai, Yingchih
T2  - Aerospace
AB  - The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is widely used in various applications of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) that require precise positioning or navigation. However, GNSS signals can be blocked in specific environments and are susceptible to jamming and spoofing, which will degrade the performance of navigation systems. In this study, a deep learning-based navigation system for the automatic landing of fixed-wing UAVs in GNSS-denied environments is proposed to serve as an alternative navigation system. Most visual-based runway landing systems are typically focused on runway detection and localization while neglecting the issue of integrating the localization solution into flight control and guidance laws to become a complete real-time automatic landing system. This study addresses these problems by combining runway detection and localization methods, YOLOv8 and CNN (convolutional neural network) regression, to demonstrate the robustness of deep learning approaches. Moreover, a line detection method is employed to accurately align the UAV with the runway, effectively resolving issues related to runway contours. In the control phase, the guidance law and controller are designed to ensure the stable flight of the UAV. Based on a deep learning model framework, this study conducts experiments within the simulation environment, verifying system stability under various assumed conditions, thereby avoiding the risks associated with real-world testing. The simulation results demonstrate that the UAV can achieve automatic landing on 3-degree and 5-degree glide slopes, whether it is directly aligned with the runway or deviating from it, with trajectory tracking errors within 10 m. © 2025 by the authors.

T2  - Optimization and Engineering
AB  - We consider a type of routing problems common in defence and security, in which we control a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that have to reach one or more target locations without being detected by an adversary. Detection can be carried out by a variety of sensors (radio receivers, cameras, personnel, etc) placed by the adversary around the target sites. We model the act of detecting a UAV from first principles by noting that sensors work by monitoring frequencies in the electromagnetic spectrum for signals or noise emitted. By this, we are able to provide a flexible and versatile nonlinear optimisation framework in which the problem is modeled as a novel trajectory optimisation problem with paths of the UAVs as continuous arcs in an Euclidean space. The flexibility of our approach is exhibited by the fact that we can easily consider various relevant objectives, among them minimising the overall probability of detection and maximising the location error that the adversary experiences when trying to locate our UAVs. Our model is also versatile enough to consider the act of jamming, in which one or more of our UAVs intentionally send out signals to interfere with the operations of the adversary’s sensors. Numerical results show the flexibility of our framework, and that we can solve realistic instances of this problem type. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that chaotic maps are well-suited for applications requiring unpredictable behaviour, making them a valuable tool for enhancing unpredictability and complexity. A method is developed using 3D parametric equations to make boundary surveillance more robust and flexible to effectively cover and adapt to the ever-changing situations of boundary surveillance. A non-autonomous discrete memristor hyperchaotic map is utilized to significantly enhance the unpredictability of trajectories in boundary surveillance. Since the scaling property is an affine transformation, and the hyperchaotic systems are invariant under affine transformations, the adaptability of hyperchaotic trajectories is visually demonstrated by applying the scaling property for robust path planning. Furthermore, hyperchaotic systems enable the generation of mutually independent trajectories with slight variations in initial conditions, allowing multiple quadrotors to operate simultaneously along a single guiding path. This minimizes the chance of overlap and interference, ensuring effective and coordinated surveillance. © 2025 The Author(s)

AB  - The localization system is the most important part of the overall drone navigation system. The Global Positioning System (GPS) or Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is the main device commonly used in a drone. However, under certain conditions, GPS or GNSS may not function optimally, such as in situations of signal jamming or enclosed environments. This paper implemented a new approach to address this issue by combining GNSS data with Visual Odometry (VO) through Machine Learning (ML) methods. The followed process consists of three main stages. First, performing speed and orientation estimation using VO. Second, performing left and right feature separation on the images to generate a more stable and robust estimation of speed and rotation. Third, refining speed and orientation estimation by integrating GNSS data through ML-based data fusion. The proposed method strives to enhance drone localization accuracy, despite disruptions or unavailability of GNSS signals. The research results indicate that the introduced method significantly reduces Absolute Translation Error (ATE) compared to utilizing VO or GNSS separately. The average ATE produced reached 4.38 m and an orientation of 8.26°, indicating that this data fusion approach provides a significant improvement in drone localization accuracy, making it reliable in operational scenarios with limited GNSS signals. © by the authors.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown significant advantages in disaster relief, emergency communication, and Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC). However, the escalating demand for UAV spectrum is severely restricted by the scarcity of available spectrum, which in turn significantly limits communication performance. Additionally, the openness of the wireless channel poses a serious threat, such as wiretapping and jamming. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the security performance of the system. Recently, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), as a highly promising technology, has been integrated into Cognitive UAV Network. This integration enhances the legitimate signal while suppressing the eavesdropping signal. This paper investigates a RIS-assisted Cognitive UAV Network with multiple corresponding receiving users as cognitive users (CUs) in the presence of malicious eavesdroppers (Eav), in which the Cognitive UAV functions as the mobile aerial Base Station (BS) to transmit confidential messages for the users on the ground. Our primary aim is to attain the maximum secrecy bits by means of jointly optimizing the transmit power, access scheme of the CUs, the RIS phase shift matrix, and the trajectory. In light of the fact that the access scheme is an integer, the original problem proves to be a mixed integer non-convex one, which falls into the NP-hard category. To solve this problem, we propose block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation (BCD-SCA) algorithms. Firstly, we introduce the BCD algorithm to decouple the coupled variables and convert the original problem into four sub-problems for the non-convex subproblems to solve by the SCA algorithm. The results of our simulations indicate that the joint optimization scheme we have put forward not only achieves robust convergence but also outperforms conventional benchmark approaches. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - The under-canopy environment, which is inherently inaccessible to humans, necessitates the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for data collection. The implementation of UAV autonomous navigation in such environments faces challenges, including dense obstacles, GNSS signal interference, and varying lighting conditions. This paper introduces a UAV autonomous navigation method specifically designed for under-canopy environments. Initially, image enhancement techniques are integrated with neural network-based visual feature extraction. Subsequently, employs a high-dimensional error-state optimizer coupled with a low-dimensional height filter to achieve high-precision localization of the UAV in under-canopy environments. Furthermore, proposes a boundary sampling autonomous exploration algorithm and an advanced Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) path planning algorithm. The objective is to enhance the reliability and safety of UAV operations beneath the forest canopy, thereby establishing a technical foundation for surveying vertically stratified natural resources. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - The flexibility and cost-effectiveness of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in a wide range of scenarios have made them indispensable tools for mobile communications. However, UAV communications are also facing increasing security threats, especially in open spaces where they are vulnerable to potential eavesdroppers. In this paper, we employ an extra UAV as a cooperative jammer to enhance UAV-to-ground communication security by sending artificial noise to effectively resist passive eavesdroppers. Unlike previous work, we focus on the dynamic scenario where the source UAV and the ground user move simultaneously. In this scenario, we propose a joint optimization algorithm of trajectory and power for the jamming UAV to obtain the optimal jamming strategy. Due to the absence of eavesdroppers’ locations, the goal of the optimization is to maximize a secure region. Numerical results demonstrate that our optimization algorithm can significantly enlarge the secure region compared to randomly selecting a position of the jamming UAV. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - High altitude platforms (HAPs) are emerging as the critical enabler for the next generation communication system, due to their broad coverage, long endurance and high payload. However, the open and broadcast nature of wireless links makes HAP system susceptible to information eavesdropping. This paper investigates the secure downlink transmission for an HAP network, where one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jammer is utilized against multiple mobile eavesdroppers (Eves) with imperfect location information. We aim to maximize the minimum average secrecy rate (MASR) by jointly optimizing subcarrier scheduling, subcarrier power allocation, UAV trajectory and HAP deployment. To address the formulated mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, we first derive the optimal HAP deployment and utilize an estimation error model to resolve the locational uncertainty of the Eves. Subsequently, a low-complexity iterative algorithm is proposed, which decomposes the problem into three manageable subproblems and iteratively solves them to obtain a near-optimal solution. The convergence and complexity of the algorithm are further analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves not only the MASR but also the fairness between terminal devices, which outperforms the baselines without resource allocation and/or trajectory optimization. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

AB  - To realize the defense task of precise directional drive off of unmanned combat system in the target area, an anti-unmanned directional drive-off method under SINS(Strapdown Inertial Navigation System)/GPS(Global Positioning System) integrated navigation mode is proposed in this paper, which is suitable for the security defense of important places, urban public security protection and anti-terrorism and stability maintenance in sensitive areas. Firstly, this paper constructs a seven dimensional SINS/GPS integrated navigation model of unmanned combat system including horizontal position, velocity and attitude, and uses discrete Kalman filter for data fusion; Then, combined with the coupling relationship between various state parameters of SINS/GPS integrated navigation, the controllability and stability of false satellite signal acting on the position output of integrated navigation are analyzed, and then the feasibility of satellite navigation spoofing under SINS/GPS integrated navigation mode is deduced; Finally, the false satellite signal is designed and constructed to make the position estimation of SINS/GPS Integrated Navigation drive away accurately. The simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness and correctness of the anti-unmanned directional drive-off method under the integrated navigation mode. Note to Practitioners - This work is motivated by the need for the defense task of precise directional drive off of unmanned combat system in the target area. Most unmanned combat platforms adopt the integrated navigation mode with satellite navigation system as an auxiliary means. It can be challenging for researchers and practitioners to drive off the unmanned combat system which adopt the integrated navigation mode in the target area by the existing spoofing methods. Therefore, this paper presents an accurate directional displacement method against unmanned under the SINS/GPS integrated navigation mode and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by UAV spoofing simulation and test. This paper provides researchers and practitioners with comprehensive reference sources in anti-Unmanned directional drive-off method under integrated navigation mode, which can help them develop suitable solutions to drive off the unmanned combat system which adopt the integrated navigation mode in the target area. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - To address the challenges of dynamic jamming and resource optimization in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) confrontation communication networks, this paper proposes a hierarchical game framework for joint trajectory design and power allocation. These elements are inherently coupled: jamming degrades channel quality, prompting UAVs to adapt both their trajectories to improve spatial positioning and reduce jamming exposure, and their power allocation to maintain communication effectiveness under interference. The framework captures this interplay through a differential game for trajectory optimization and a Stackelberg game for power allocation, with the Nash equilibrium (NE) rigorously defined and its existence proved. To overcome the complexity of solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, an adaptive dynamic programming algorithm is employed to approximate the value functions for both trajectory and power optimization. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating that it accurately captures the strategic interactions between UAVs and provides robust decision support for resource optimization in dynamic adversarial environments. © 2014 IEEE.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems
AB  - Efficient management of limited resources, reduced data transmission latency, and improved overall network performance are critical in ground networks. This paper proposes a hierarchical sensing and offloading framework for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), where unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) act as mobile data aggregators to support ITS monitoring in areas beyond roadside unit (RSU) coverage, during RSU outages, or under severe ground network congestion. By enabling localized offloading, the framework ensures the timely delivery of critical ITS data. The proposed secrecy-aware approach enhances the resilience, efficiency, and integrity of ITS sensing and communications. Although UAVs offer advantages such as high mobility, on-demand deployment, and reliance on line-of-sight (LoS) communication channels, they remain vulnerable to security threats. To counter eavesdropping and jamming threats, the proposed method combines policy-gradient reinforcement learning with protective jamming and secrecy-aware transmission scheduling, enabling UAVs to adaptively adjust flight paths, transmit power, and time slot assignments. A multi-objective reward function is designed to jointly optimize secrecy rate, communication delay, and energy consumption under adversarial conditions. Extensive simulations confirm the proposed model’s effectiveness in enhancing communication security and operational efficiency across varying threat scenarios. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is widely used in Internet of Things (IoT) network applications, especially for data collection. However, the UAV’s predictable trajectory makes it vulnerable to jamming attacks. This paper optimizes the UAV’s control input by introducing the stochastic control method to make the UAV’s trajectory unpredictable to potential attackers. Based on the stochastic control method, where a random input is added into the control law, the control input optimization problem is decomposed into the navigation optimization problem and the stochastic optimization problem. The navigation optimization problem optimizes the UAV’s guidance toward its final destination while considering the constraints of its data collection mission. Meanwhile, the stochastic optimization problem minimizes external factors and internal costs while considering unpredictability. The two optimization problems are addressed using an MPC-based method and a modified gradient descent algorithm, respectively. Simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed unpredictable optimization strategy and the proposed method. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - With the widespread application of communication technology in the non-terrestrial network (NTN), the issue of the insecure communication due to the inherent openness of the NTN is increasingly being recognized. Consequently, safeguarding communication information in the NTN has emerged as a critical challenge. To address this issue, we propose a beamforming and horizontal trajectory joint optimization method for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) covert communications in the NTN. First, we formulate an optimization problem that considers constraints such as the transmitting power and the distance. Moreover, we employ the integrated communication and jamming (ICAJ) signal as Alice’s transmitting signal, further protecting the content of communication information. Next, we construct two subproblems, and we propose an alternate optimization (AO) algorithm based on quadratic transform and penalty term method to solve the proposed two subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and has better performance than benchmarks. © China Communications Magazine Co., Ltd.

In this paper, a multi-mode jamming scheme based on software radio is proposed for UAV communication and navigation links. The UAV data link is blocked by comb and sweep interference techniques. Combined with generative navigation spoofing technology to achieve navigation link deception, the interference parameters are optimized by introducing the third-generation genetic algorithm to improve the success rate of interference. Based on the software radio, the UAV is tested for jamming, and the experiment shows that: comb jamming and frequency sweeping jamming can cut off the control link, and the navigation deception makes the UAV deviate from the preset path, which realizes the effective jamming of the UAV. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - Reliable and continuous position is critical for a Low-altitude Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can generate navigation solutions. However, navigation solutions from the GNSS are not always reliable due to the possible signal jamming, interference and blockage. In view of the drawbacks, in this paper, we proposed a GNSS/Visual integrated navigation system for low-altitude UAV under signal challenging environments. The visual positing system (VPS) is composed of a front-end visual odometry and back-end aerial-satellite images matching based absolute position module. In the front-end task, the consecutive top-view aerial images from UAV cameras are matched frame-by-frame to realize the relative motion estimation; in the back-end task, satellite remote sensing images after fine calibration are matched with the top-view UAV aerial images to estimate the absolute position. Deep learning methods XFeat and SuperGlue are utilized in the front-end and back-end individually. Front-end and back-end modules in the VPS work cooperatively to generate position, which is then integrated with the GNSS using Adaptive Factor Graph Optimization (AFGO) to realize more reliable position information. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated through four long-distance flight tests, with an average position error of approximately 10.14 meters. When a GNSS outage was introduced along the flight path, the system can still output positioning result with the VPS. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2025, The Aeronautical and Astronautical Society of the Republic of China. All rights reserved.

AB  - Unmanned autonomous system (UAS) swarms empower groups of robotic agents (such as drones) to collectively accomplish complex missions by navigating intricate environments, but face significant challenges when operating in contested areas with electromagnetic jamming that disrupts interagent communication. This paper introduces an innovative hierarchical control strategy that enables a drone swarm to traverse complex terrains, including regions compromised by electromagnetic jamming intended to disrupt communications. The swarm is initially unaware of the existence or location of these jamming regions, making autonomous detection and avoidance critical for mission success. The proposed strategy synergistically combines communication-aware formation control, particle swarm optimization (PSO) for reactive navigation, and a global path planner for deadlock resolution to ensure the swarm maintains optimal communication quality and mission continuity. A gradient controller maintains the desired swarm formation by maximizing communication quality among agents, while a PSO-based movement controller navigates toward a destination, avoiding newly discovered jamming areas. To address potential deadlocks, a path planning algorithm is invoked to generate a globally optimal route. The framework operates without prior knowledge of jamming locations, learning threat positions through real-time environmental interaction. A comparative analysis of various path planning algorithms, including A*, Greedy Best-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra, Jump Point Search, and Theta*, is presented through simulation. The results demonstrate that A* provides optimal performance for our integrated framework, facilitating efficient and robust navigation for the UAS swarms, while maintaining high communication quality among individual drones. © 2013 IEEE.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems
AB  - GNSS-based attitude determination (AD) is essential for various applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles and land vehicle navigation, but its performance is severely threatened by jamming. This paper proposes a two-stage GNSS-DOA (direction of-arrival) based method to enhance AD performance under jamming conditions. The first stage employs the SWN-MUSIC algorithm to provide the most accurate DOA estimates possible within given jamming constraints. The second stage, as the focus of this work, addresses the varying impacts of jamming on GNSS signals with different DOAs and investigates how to leverage these signals through a weighting strategy to enhance AD precision and reliability. To achieve this, we propose a CRLB (Craḿ er-Rao Lower Bound)-based weighting algorithm, which evaluates DOA estimation precision using the CRLB and generates corresponding weights for AD. The proposed weights incorporate traditional adaptive signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio as one component, while the other component, we define as the DOA estimation sensitivity, provides additional insights into DOA precision. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves AD accuracy compared to existing weighting methods, with particularly notable improvements in the worst-case scenarios across Monte Carlo trials. The findings highlight the robustness and practicality of the two-stage method, particularly in jamming scenarios and with small-scale GNSS antenna arrays, offering enhanced reliability under adverse conditions. © 1965-2011 IEEE.

AB  - [Background] The operational reliability of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is critically dependent on their global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). However, in the increasingly contested electromagnetic environments, the inherent weakness of GNSS signals makes them highly susceptible to suppression jamming, leading to performance degradation or mission failure. Existing test standards often focus on single-jammer, static scenarios and lack the quantitative rigor needed to assess the performance of advanced multi-element antenna systems under complex, dynamic conditions. [Purpose] This research aims to address this gap by developing and validating a standardized, quantitative test methodology for evaluating the anti-suppression-jamming performance of UAV GNSS systems. The objective is to create a reproducible framework that can simulate dynamic, multi-source interference and provide a comprehensive assessment from the radio frequency (RF) front-end to the complete system level. [Methods] A hybrid test methodology integrating direct radio frequency injection and over-the-air (OTA) spatial irradiation was established within a microwave anechoic chamber. This “injection-irradiation” approach facilitates a full-link evaluation. Both static and dynamic tests were conducted on a seven-element GNSS adaptive array receiver. Static tests involved assessing performance against an increasing number of jammers (one to six) from fixed spatial locations. Dynamic tests simulated UAV maneuvers by placing the receiver on a turntable rotating at 2 °/s, exposing it to a changing interference geometry. Performance was quantified by the jamming-to-signal (J/S) ratio threshold, carrier-to-noise ratio, and positioning success rate. [Results] Static tests quantified a distinct saturation effect on the receiver’s spatial filtering capability; the J/S ratio threshold for positioning failure decreased from 106 dB against a single continuous-wave jammer to 60 dB against six broadband noise jammers. Critically, dynamic tests revealed a complex spatio-temporal coupling effect. In the six-jammer scenario, the system maintained a 100% positioning success rate at a J/S ratio of 70 dB while rotating, paradoxically outperforming its 60 dB static failure threshold. This demonstrates that the constant change in interference geometry can prevent the algorithm from settling into a worst-case nulling solution. [Conclusions] The proposed combined injection-irradiation and dynamic test methodology provides a robust and standardized framework for the quantitative assessment of UAV GNSS anti-jamming capabilities. The findings reveal that static tests alone are insufficient for predicting performance, as dynamic conditions can fundamentally alter the system’s response to multi-source interference. This research offers a critical tool for the realistic evaluation, design optimization, and validation of navigation systems intended for operation in complex electromagnetic environments. © 2025, Editorial Office of High Power Laser and Particle Beams.

AB  - [Background] Modern battlefields are increasingly characterized by complex electromagnetic environments (EME), posing significant challenges to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operational effectiveness. [Purpose] To address this issue, this study aims to quantitatively evaluate how complex EME affects UAV operational effectiveness using a multi-level framework, incorporating defined key metrics including anti-jamming capability verification. [Methods] A three-tier evaluation model was developed, incorporating EME complexity, subsystem performance, and operational capabilities. EME complexity was characterized by four metrics weighted via AHP. Critical subsystem indicators—such as communication reliability and navigation accuracy—and operational capabilities like mission execution and anti-jamming performance were causally mapped within an environment-effectiveness mapping. This mapping enabled the model to be normalized and integrated using sensitivity coefficients, and stochastic jamming scenarios were simulated in MATLAB to validate the approach. [Results] The results demonstrated a distinct negative exponential relationship between EME complexity and operational effectiveness. Performance declined progressively with intensified EME, but notably, UAVs equipped with advanced anti-jamming systems maintained higher effectiveness under identical conditions. [Conclusions] This study confirms the critical importance of anti-jamming technologies in preserving UAV combat capability in complex EME; the proposed evaluation framework offers practical insights for developing robust UAV systems suited to contested electromagnetic spectra. © 2025, Editorial Office of High Power Laser and Particle Beams.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate a novel model of an Unmanned aerial vehicle(UAV) secure communication, where a UAV base station(UAV-B) moves around to communicate with desired user on the ground while another friendly UAV jammer(UAV-J) in the area jams the eavesdroppers on the ground to protect communications of the desired users. Different from the classical UAV-assisted secure communication, we observe that there is a symmetry relation between the UAV-B and UAV-J. Based on this fact, we modify the original objective function. Specifically, we maximize the minimum worst-case system data rate among the users and eavesdroppers within each period by jointly adjusting UAV trajectories and user scheduling. As, the optimization problem is non-convex with coupled optimization variables, we decompose the optimization problem into two subproblems and use alternating iteration algorithm and successive convex approximation techniques to solve it. Compared with existing schemes, the proposed algorithm has an obvious advantage in the secrecy rate. © 2025 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.

AB  - Accurate 6-DoF pose estimation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is crucial for autonomy but challenged by issues like GPS-denial and the difficulty of acquiring large-scale labeled real-world data. This paper investigates the feasibility of training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) exclusively on synthetic RGB-D data for drone pose estimation, targeting applications such as indoor navigation and pose tracking (distance, azimuth, elevation). We propose SlicingCNN3D, a custom architecture utilizing sparse convolutions on voxelized point clouds derived from RGB-D input, and compare it against a Point Cloud Transformer (PCT) baseline. Models were trained solely on synthetic data generated in Blender, with and without noise augmentation, and evaluated on real-world data captured using a ZED 2i camera observing a Parrot ANAFI drone. Our results demonstrate successful sim-to-real transfer, with noise augmentation proving beneficial for robustness. The proposed SlicingCNN3D, if trained with noise, achieved promising real-world performance, yielding an overall positional error (e<inf>XYZ</inf>) of approximately 11.7 cm and notably outperforming PCT in Yaw estimation (12.1<sup>∘</sup>vs. 30.7<sup>∘</sup>error), a critical parameter for flight direction. Our findings validate the synthetic-only training approach as a viable pathway of developing capable DNNs for UAV pose estimation from RGB-D sensors. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - This paper introduces the concept of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) corridors as structured, wirelessoptimized flight paths to reduce collision risks and enhance safety in urban environments. To address challenges such as signal interference and collisions at shared altitudes, we formulate the UAV trajectory planning and task offloading problem as a continuous-time integer nonlinear programming problem, considering communication constraints, time delay, task offloading, and energy consumption. A novel Signal-Interference Proximal Policy Optimization (SI-PPO) algorithm is proposed, incorporating a reward mechanism based on signal interference to improve UAV coordination in dense urban areas. Simulation results demonstrate that SI-PPO significantly outperforms traditional methods such as Deep Q-Learning (DQN), Simulated Annealing (SA), Greedy Algorithm, and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) in terms of trajectory optimization, delay reduction, and energy efficiency. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - The rapid advancement of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology has led to its increasingly widespread application in both military and civilian sectors. However, the security risks posed by non-cooperative drones have become increasingly prominent. Traditional interception methods, such as net capture and high-power signal suppression, are limited by factors including short effective range and high costs. This paper proposes a lightweight navigation jamming and spoofing system. By designing a highly integrated navigation receiver antenna, transmitting antenna, and jamming source host, the system supports flexible switching between three operational modes. This capability enables effective management and control of non-cooperative drones. Experimental results demonstrate that the system successfully achieves both static jamming and dynamic spoofing of target drones, significantly enhancing the precision and reliability of UAV countermeasures. The development of this system offers a novel approach for low-cost, high-efficiency drone countermeasures, showcasing significant potential for application. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is of crucial importance in realizing heterogeneous practical wireless application scenarios. However, the densely populated users and diverse services with high data rate demands has triggered an increasing scarcity of UAV spectrum utilization. To tackle this problem, it is promising to incorporate the underutilized unlicensed spectrum with the licensed spectrum to boost network capacity. However, the openness of unlicensed spectrum makes UAVs susceptible to security threats from potential jammers. Therefore, a spectrum sharing UAV network coexisting with licensed cellular network and unlicensed Wi-Fi network is considered with the anti-jamming technique in this paper. The sum rate maximization of the secondary network is studied by jointly optimizing the transmit power, subchannel allocation, and UAV trajectory. We first decompose the challenging non-convex problem into two subproblems, 1) the joint power and subchannel allocation and 2) UAV trajectory design subproblems. A low-complexity iterative algorithm is proposed in a alternating optimization manner over these two subproblems to solve the formulated problem. Specifically, the Lagrange dual decomposition is exploited to jointly optimize the transmit power and subchannel allocation iteratively. Then, an efficient iterative algorithm capitalizing on successive convex approximation is designed to get a suboptimal solution for UAV trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can significantly improve the sum transmission rate compared with the benchmark schemes. © 2025 IEEE.

AU  - MacHumilane, Achilles Kiwanuka

AU  - Cassarà, Pietro
AB  - Path planning and optimization for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted next-generation wireless networks is critical for mobility management and ensuring UAV safety and ubiquitous connectivity, especially in dense urban environments with street canyons and tall buildings. Traditional statistical and model-based techniques have been successfully used for path optimization in communication networks. However, when dynamic channel propagation characteristics such as line-of-sight (LOS), interference, handover, and signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) are included in path optimization, statistical and model-based path planning solutions become obsolete since they cannot adapt to the dynamic and time-varying wireless channels, especially in the mmWave bands. In this paper, we propose a novel model-free actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (AC-DRL) framework for path optimization in UAV-assisted 5G mmWave wireless networks, which combines four important aspects of UAV communication: flight time, handover, connectivity and SINR. We train an AC-RL agent that enables a UAV connected to a gNB to determine the optimal path to a desired destination in the shortest possible time with minimal gNB handover, while maintaining connectivity and the highest possible SINR. We train our model with data from a powerful ray tracing tool called Wireless InSite, which uses 3D images of the propagation environment and provides data that closely resembles the real propagation environment. The simulation results show that our system has superior performance in tracking high SINR compared to other selected RL algorithms. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - To integrate physical layer security and information freshness, this work first proposes the concepts of secure age of information (SAoI) and secure peak AoI (PAoI). Then, four optimizing policies are proposed as well as the suboptimal framework and solutions. The first is the secure PAoI (SPAoI) threshold-constrained Min-PAoI policy, which minimizes the average PAol at the legitimate destination by assuming the SPAol is greater than a threshold. The second is the Max-SPAoI policy which maximizes the average SPAoI. The third is the Max-SPAoI-EC ratio policy which maximizes the ratio of SPAoI to UAV energy consumption (EC). The final one is the SPAoI threshold-constrained Min-WS-PAoI-EC policy, which minimizes the weighted sum of PAoI and UAV EC. The last two policies are energy-efficient. The simulations show that the Min-PAoI policy has the largest range of UAV flights. Both Min-PAoI and Min-WS-PAoI-EC policies have smaller SPAoI, but the two policies achieve the fresher status update. The Min-WS-PAoI-EC policy is more promising because of the low PAoI, security guarantee, and high energy efficiency. © 2025 IEEE.

TI  - Bridging Simulation and Reality: A 3D Clustering-Based Deep Learning Model for UAV-Based RF Source Localization
AU  - Masrur, Saad
AU  - Güvenç, İsmail
AB  - Localization of radio frequency (RF) sources has critical applications, including search and rescue, jammer detection, and monitoring of hostile activities. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer significant advantages for RF source localization (RFSL) over terrestrial methods, leveraging autonomous 3D navigation and capturing stronger signals at higher altitudes. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have further enhanced localization accuracy, particularly for outdoor scenarios. DL models often face challenges in real-world deployment due to training on simulated datasets that do not fully replicate real-world conditions. To address this, we first propose the Enhanced Two-Ray propagation model, reducing the simulation-to-reality gap by improving the accuracy of propagation environment modeling. For RFSL, we propose the 3D Cluster-Based RealAdap-tRNet, a DL-based method that leverages 3D clustering-based feature extraction for robust localization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Enhanced Two-Ray model provides superior accuracy in simulating real-world propagation scenarios. Notably, the 3D Cluster-Based RealAdaptRNet, trained entirely on simulated data, achieves exceptional performance when validated in a real-world setting using the AERPAW physical testbed, with an average localization error of 18.2 m. The proposed approach is computationally efficient - using 33.5× fewer parameters - and generalizes well across diverse trajectories, making it highly suitable for real-world applications. © 2025 IEEE.

AU  - Ali Shah, Syed Ammad

AU  - Kashef, Rasha F.
AB  - Pilot assignment is a major issue in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled user centric (UC) cell- free massive multiple input and multiple output (UC-CF-mMIMO) wireless networks where, UAVs function as distributed mobile aerial access points (MAAPs). In this paper, an efficient Tabu-search (TS) based pilot assignment scheme is proposed to address this issue where, a penalty based objective function maintains a minimum distance between mobile units (MUs). This scheme utilizes a local neighborhood search, where we first define the neighborhood structure and set the objective function. The proposed algorithm iteratively identifies a near-optimal solution with low computational overhead and achieves high average channel estimate power. We implemented a gradient based (GB) algorithm to optimize the 3D locations of MAAPs and find the signal-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expression. Numerical simulations show that proposed TS-based strategy and MAAP trajectory optimization significantly enhance the per-user throughput with 95%-likelihood. The results achieved with proposed method are better than the conventional random pilot assignment schemes such as, gradient based and gibbs sampling (GB-GS), user centric perfect channel state information(UC-PSCI) and mMIMO based PCSI method while maintaining similar complexity. © 2025 IEEE.

AU  - Guo, Yuxin

AB  - With the rapid advancement of communication technologies, spectrum resources have become increasingly scarce, prompting the development of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology. However, the inherent openness of wireless channels makes transmitted information vulnerable to interference and eavesdropping, posing significant security challenges. Most existing studies focus on specific technologies or scenarios without offering comprehensive and systematic solutions. To address these limitations, we propose a secure ISAC system for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted by intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS). By jointly optimizing the IRS phase shift, active beamforming, UAV trajectory, and artificial noise (AN) allocation, the system secrecy rate is maximized while satisfying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. We propose an iterative alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that decomposes the problem into three convex sub-problems, each solved efficiently. Simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm significantly improves transmission security and sensing performance, effectively mitigates eavesdropping, and provides a robust solution for ISAC system security. © 2025 IEEE.

TI  - USV Trajectory Optimization Based Legitimate Maritime Wireless Surveillance
AU  - Hu, Zheng
AU  - Xu, Qichao
AB  - To facilitate detection of vessels involved in potentially illegal maritime activities and uphold maritime security, wireless surveillance of suspicious wireless links through eavesdropping technology without requiring physical proximity has emerged as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, effective wireless surveillance of maritime wireless links confronts critical challenges, such as the highly dynamic and complex ocean environment and the risk of being detected during close-range surveillance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cooperative maritime wireless surveillance scheme for suspicious communication links, utilizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jamming to assist unmanned surface vehicle (USV) monitoring. Specifically, a proactive eavesdropping framework is firstly established, wherein a UAV and a USV collaborate to monitor target link. The UAV transmits beamforming jamming signals to degrade suspicious communications, while the USV conducts eavesdropping to extract valuable information. To maximize the average monitoring rate, an optimization problem is formulated to optimize the trajectory of USV, subject to the mobility constraints during the monitoring process. Given the nonconvex nature of the problem arising from coupled variables and nonlinear constraints, a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm is designed to solve the original problem. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional methods. © 2025 IEEE.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology
AB  - This paper investigates the trade-off between relay communication and intra-swarm communication performance in UAV swarms operating under communication and navigation jamming environments, aiming to optimize the link between UAV swarms and the ground station. Specifically, during the UAV swarm's flight towards a predefined destination, the relay UAV selection, including external relay UAV and inter-swarm relay UAVs, and relay communication power allocation need to balance external relay communication, inter-swarm relay communication and intra-swarm communication performance. The external relay communication in this context refers to the communication between relay UAVs and the ground base station, with its power consumption also taken into account. Inter-swarm communication denotes the communication between external relay UAV and inter-swarm relay UAVs. Given that relay selection and power allocation in this problem exhibit non-convex multi-objective optimization properties, we propose using a game-theoretic framework to obtain a balanced equilibrium solution. The UAVs adjust their relay selection and power allocation strategies to maximize swarm and relay communication rates while minimizing relay power consumption, which has been proven to be an exact potential game, ensuring the existence of a Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy. To solve the equilibrium strategy, and considering the diversity of equilibrium solutions in the flight environment, as well as the continuity of spatial location, navigation, and communication performance parameters, we propose a solution algorithm based on a maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MERL) framework. Simulation results highlight the algorithm's superiority over tabular reinforcement learning and conventional strategies, achieving lower power consumption and reduced communication interruptions between the swarm and ground station in high-interference environments. This research provides valuable insights into UAV swarm collaborative positioning based on communication in navigation interruption environments, as UAV swarms rely on ground base stations for relative positioning information. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The rapid development of drone technology has spurred significant interest in multi-UAV collaborative systems, particularly for complex tasks like cooperative target jamming. However, realizing their full potential is hindered by significant challenges, primarily stemming from uncertain three-dimensional (3-D) target positions and operational time constraints. These factors complicate crucial aspects like path planning and efficient task allocation, ultimately jeopardizing jamming mission success. Furthermore, the specific complexities introduced by uncertain 3-D target positions are often overlooked in existing cooperative jamming strategies. To address these issues, we propose cooperative multi-agent jamming techniques using reinforcement learning (RL) to maximize interference effectiveness against designated targets under target position uncertainty. Our methodology is based on a task framework that unifies the models of target position uncertainty, 3-D probabilistic perception for high-fidelity UAV sensing, and directional antenna interference to achieve optimal jamming. Within this framework, we formalize the task as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ reinforcement learning to optimize collaborative jamming policies under target positions uncertainty. The proposed RL algorithm, by utilizing both individual and collaborator rewards, adaptively balances exploration and exploitation across different mission stages. This balance is achieved by adjusting the amplitude of noise used for action selection. We conducted simulation experiments with various UAV, target and no-fly zone configurations to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, demonstrating its scalability and strong joint task performance in achieving jamming objectives. © 2014 IEEE.

T2  - IEEE Open Journal of Vehicular Technology
AB  - With the intensification of uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) “black flight” threat, the dynamic cooperative deployment of navigation spoofing jamming sites faces the triple challenges of integrity coverage, spoofing signal mutual interference suppression, and resource cost optimization. In this paper, we propose an intelligent deployment framework that breaks through the limitations of traditional algorithms of fixing the number of stations, fixing the radius, and optimizing only the location of stations. By constructing a multi-objective optimization model, we innovatively design a hybrid optimization mechanism that includes velocity-position update with local-best-driven, site-adaptive maintenance, and directed mutation. Among them, the local-best-driven module generates particle motion gradients through site-level dual-objective evaluation to solve the global guidance failure problem in dynamic scenarios; the site-adaptive maintenance module achieves site-level dynamic optimization through the judgement of site absence and redundancy; and the directed mutation module further optimizes the redundant resources through the transformation of inefficient sites. Simulation results demonstrate that this method significantly improves the reliability and economy of the deployment of the active protection system in the complex electromagnetic environment and provides theoretical support for the construction of adaptive protection networks in critical areas such as cities and coastal areas. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Combining Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (AAVs) with public transportation systems offers a novel approach to enhancing urban last-mile delivery efficiency. However, current research lacks comprehensive solutions for optimizing AAV path planning that can adapt to real-time changes in public transportation schedules while avoiding dynamically changing high-interference zones, ensuring consistent drone connectivity, and accounting for limited drone battery life. This paper addresses these gaps by optimizing and balancing multiple objectives, such as ensuring early arrival, minimizing energy consumption, and reducing signal interference. To achieve these goals, we propose a Q-learning-based algorithm for real-time path optimization, ensuring path adaptability to random changes in interference zones and public transportation schedules, and compare its performance against multi-objective A∗ algorithm variants. Results show that Q-learning achieves superior early arrival times, energy efficiency, and reduced interference, with a nearly 100% success rate in package deliveries, compared to 60-80% for A∗. These findings demonstrate the robustness and reliability of Q-learning in AAV-Aided Public Transportation systems, making it a valuable solution for real-world urban delivery challenges. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - In modern warfare, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms frequently encounter signal interference or denial from adversaries, posing significant challenges to localization accuracy. Nevertheless, the large-scale advantage of UAV swarms enables interfered UAVs to utilize relative navigation techniques by leveraging communication and relative measurements. Thus, we discuss a multi-agent distributed cooperative localization method based on ultra-wideband (UWB) modules. First, a distributed Kalman filtering-based multi-UAV cooperative localization algorithm is proposed, achieving high-precision localization under partial GNSS-denied conditions. Second, a multi-agent distributed cooperative localization algorithm incorporating an analysis of UWB non-stationary measurement noise characteristics is introduced, enhancing the robustness of swarm navigation in dynamic formations. Finally, a UWBbased distributed multi-UAV cooperative localization prototype system is developed, comprising five small UAVs equipped with inertial measurement unit (IMU), GPS modules, and UWB modules. Experimental evaluations under various scenarios compare and analyze swarm navigation performance under different conditions. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - Multi-GNSS systems, including GPS and Galileo, are increasingly vital in military applications due to their improved accuracy, reliability, and availability. These systems offer redundancy, ensuring uninterrupted navigation even in challenging conditions like jamming or spoofing. They are critical for guiding unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), precision-guided missiles, and border monitoring. Additionally, in adverse weather or low-visibility environments, the combined signals from multiple constellations enhance location precision and system stability, ensuring mission success. A study comparing the accuracy of GPS, Galileo, and GPS+Galileo combinations using SwaP-C GNSS modules for defence applications found that Galileo provided superior 3D precision over extended periods, while GPS was more accurate for short-duration datasets. The GPS+Galileo combination demonstrated enhanced positional accuracy and dependability, highlighting its potential for demanding defence operations where high precision and reliability are crucial. © 2025 IEEE.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication is recognized as a promising technique in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to address the issue of ineffective transmission of road condition data and driving instructions caused by obstruction and random fading of ground channels. However, the inherently open channel characteristics in UAV to ground links brings new secure and covert problem in vehicular IoV which largely limit the applications of UAV in IoV. To resolve the issue, this work studies a UAV-enabled covert autonomous vehicular communication network where a UAV is deployed as a relay aided by a jammer to assist the data transmission from the base station to an autonomous vehicle without being detected by a warden whose exact location is unknown. For network performance boosting with transmission covertness consideration, an upload throughput maximization problem is formulated by jointly designing UAV trajectory and resource allocation under a more generally joint covertness constraints. To solve the complicated and highly non-convex problem which contains a large number of variables, we first analyze the detection performance and derives the closed-form expressions of the warden’s minimal detection error probability considering the warden’s location uncertainty. Then, the characterizations on the convexity of minimal detection error probability and the optimal transmission rate are provided, which helps in simplifying original problem and developing an efficient iterative algorithm to solve this problem based on a proposed novel convex approximation method. Simulations are offered to demonstrate the superior convergence, throughput, computation time, and covertness performance of proposed scheme in UAV-enabled vehicular network. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents an experimental analysis of the impact of various jamming signal types on the performance of modern global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers, including those for the Global Positioning System (GPS) and GLONASS. The ability to effectively disrupt GNSS signals is of growing importance in both military and civilian domains. In military scenarios, GNSS jamming supports navigation warfare (NAVWAR) operations by degrading the adversary's positioning and timing capabilities, while also enabling protection against unauthorized unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) activity. In civilian contexts, understanding jamming mechanisms is essential for developing robust mitigation techniques and securing critical infrastructure, such as air traffic control, maritime navigation, and telecommunications. The paper compares the effectiveness of several jamming waveforms, including continuous wave, binary phase shift keying (BPSK), additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), and intermittent five-carrier signals, based on measured jamming-to-signal ratios (JSRs). A novel energy-efficient jamming method is proposed, demonstrating effective GNSS disruption with reduced power requirements, making it suitable for integration into UAV-based electronic warfare systems. © 2025 Warsaw University of Technology-Institute of Electronic Systems.

AB  - Autonomy plays a key role for efficient operations in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concepts, making precise localization of the aircraft crucial, especially during take-off and landing. Vertiports, designated landing sites for eVTOLs, can provide the means of ground-based precise positioning, such as augmented GNSS-based, vision-based or radar-based positioning. Among these, radar offers robustness against adverse weather and jamming. This paper proposes a loosely-coupled fusion architecture for both radar-based and GNSS-based 3D positioning with commonly used UAV sensors. The proposed architecture is based on Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF), which simplifies kinematic equations by incorporating a three-dimensional attitude error in the state vector while still maintaining a singularity- and gimbal-lock-free attitude representation with quaternions to describe the absolute attitude. Measurement covariances for radar and GNSS positions are calculated with the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) values, which represent the geometric relationship between the error in distance measurements and the positioning error. Flight tests with an octocopter compare INS/GNSS, INS/Radar and INS/GNSS/Radar fusion schemes. Results demonstrate that incorporating radar alongside GNSS significantly improves positioning accuracy, while maintaining flexibility through a loosely-coupled fusion architecture. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - Communication plays a role in multi-UAV to perform formation tracking missions. In complex environments, UAV communication is often subject to jamming attacks, affecting the formation process. Therefore, studying the formation tracking control problem in jamming attacks is of great significance. Typically, the actions of the UAV consist of two fundamental modules: mobility strategy and communication strategy. In this paper, we design an anti-jamming attack mixed strategy for formation tracking control of the multi-UAV system. In practical scenarios, multi-UAV systems not only require the accomplishment of formation maneuvers but also necessitate effective mitigation of jamming attacks caused by other UAVs. Therefore, we suppose there are three types of UAVs: leaders, followers, and jammers. To illustrate the interactions between multiple UAVs of the formation tracking process under jamming attack, a three-layer Stackelberg game is constructed. Leaders and followers need to resist interference from jammers during the formation tracking process with a leader-follower structure. Leaders and followers achieve formation tracking through cooperation. The interactions between jammers and the other UAVs form a non-cooperative game. Moreover, the utility functions of a mixed strategy, which contain mobility and communication strategies, are designed for the three-layer Stackelberg game. The Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium of the designed game model is proven to exist. For seeking the Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium, a tri-level actor-critic (Tri-AC) reinforcement learning algorithm is designed. The convergence of the designed algorithm is also proved theoretically. Finally, the effectiveness of the designed method is verified by various simulation experiments. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - This paper introduces a dual unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication system to facilitate secure information transfer between an Internet of Things (IoT) device and a base station in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We consider a more realistic scenario where the legitimate nodes have imperfect knowledge about the eavesdroppers' locations that can intercept information through air-to-ground and ground-to-air links. Both UAVs and energy-constrained IoT device harvest energy from radio-frequency signals transmitted by a nearby power beacon. Utilizing the harvested energy, one UAV acts as an aerial relay while the other UAV broadcasts jamming signals to ensure information secrecy. In the considered system, we formulate an average secrecy rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the time-splitting ratio, transmit powers of IoT device and UAVs, and trajectories of both UAVs. Moreover, we account for practical constraints such as collision avoidance, limited battery capacity, energy harvesting and information causality, and UAVs' maximum velocity and flying radius. The formulated problem is non-smooth and non-convex, which we first transform into a smooth objective function without affecting its optimality. Then, we relax the eavesdropper's uncertainty constraint by using Jensen's inequality and obtain upper bound of the wiretapping rate. Further, we decompose the original optimization problem into five subproblems using a block coordinate descent algorithm and transform them into convex form via successive convex approximation. These subproblems are then solved using the convex optimization tool CVX, simplex, and subgradient descent methods. Lastly, we show the effectiveness of our framework by comparing the secrecy performance with benchmark schemes in simulation results. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - In GNSS denied environments, pseudolites have to rely on prior information, such as ground anchoring points, terrain matching or other multi-source means for positioning. This paper proposes a method of dynamic networking of UAVs pseudolites for accurate navigation with only inertial navigation during GNSS denied area, which can provide accurate positioning services without prior information like anchor points. On this basis, this paper proposes a mathematical model of UAV pseudolite networking to describe the relationship of UAV flight altitude, network service coverage and anti-jamming capabilities. This model demonstrates excellent anti-interference ability, which can achieve a maximum power enhancement of up to 54.58 dB. And it can also offer another operating mode with a maximum coverage range of up to 2 675.47 km<sup>2</sup>, while still ensuring a power enhancement of 37.57dB. This method can effectively solve the problem of providing continuous positioning services as an alternative GNSS, and is also a powerful support solution for resilient Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT)<sup>[1]</sup> . © 2025, SinoMaps Press.

AB  - With the widespread application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the issue of path planning has become increasingly significant in search of suitable paths for UAVs. However, positioning errors may exist in the system carried by the UAV in practical situations, leading to the suboptimal or even unsafe path execution. In view of this, we construct the multi-UAV robust path planning model under position uncertainty by incorporating several important considerations. This can be expressed as a complicated robust optimization problem, aiming to obtain a robust optimal path for each UAV in the presence of positioning errors. Based on this, we introduce the corresponding overall cost function and its expected expression for robust evaluation. Then, we propose a novel robust particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which employs the scale-free topology to characterize the individual interactions in the swarm. And an improved explicit sampling technique is developed by introducing a sampling coefficient, where the number of samples increases proportional to the degree value for a particle in PSO, allowing effective robustness evaluation for each solution. The proposed algorithm shows great advantages on benchmark functions, compared with some other robust PSO algorithms. Further, we present the specific implementation of the multi-UAV robust path planning method based on the proposed algorithm. Finally, simulation experiments on various path planning scenarios and comparison results indicate the superiority of the developed method, which can plan a robust and effective path for each UAV. © IEEE. 2015 Chinese Institute of Electronics.

T2  - IET Radar, Sonar and Navigation
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) heavily rely on GPS, a system vulnerable to signal interference in complex urban environments. Although radar systems offer a robust alternative due to their ability to effectively penetrate adverse weather and operate in darkness, a key challenge remains: reliably identifying static architectural landmarks from sparse and noisy radar echoes. This paper proposes a novel method for creating spatio-probabilistic models (SPMs) of radar echoes from high-rise urban landmarks, enabling independent, radar-based UAV localisation. We employ kernel density rstimation on real radar data, acquired with a custom-designed X-band ENAVI radar, focusing on large arena buildings and slender spires. These SPMs are then used to detect and identify landmarks by calculating the divergence between the probability distributions of the real-time received echoes and the preestimated reference models. Our evaluation, using probabilistic divergence metrics on Wrocław's Centennial Hall and Iglica, shows that this method effectively preserves the statistical properties of the radar data, generating high-fidelity SPMs. This approach significantly improves landmark identification compared to classical correlation methods, paving the way for more robust and resilient UAV navigation systems. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Federated learning (FL) can preserve data privacy; however, it is limited by the coverage of static edge servers deployed at wireless base stations. Although an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can extend the wireless coverage of FL, it is vulnerable to security risks due to the frequent exchanges of model parameters. Therefore, we propose a UAV-assisted covert FL scheme to protect the transmission of local models from being detected by a warden. The UAV acts as a flying server to collect the local models from distributed ground devices, thereby improving the transmission quality and efficiency. We analyze the error detection probability with an optimal threshold at the warden, which poses a significant security threat to FL. Then, we derive an optimal expression of transmit power at the devices. To minimize the FL latency while satisfying the covertness constraint, the trajectory of UAV can be dynamically adjusted along with the jamming power and the local accuracy, addressing the demands of latency-sensitive applications. Specifically, we propose an iterative algorithm to divide the original problem into two subproblems, which are alternately optimized via successive convex approximation until convergence. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UAV-assisted covert FL scheme in minimizing the latency while guaranteeing the covertness. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become indispensable assets across military, commercial, and civil domains due to their operational flexibility, cost-efficiency, and real-time sensing capabilities. However, the increasing integration of UAVs into critical infrastructure, combined with their reliance on wireless communications, Global Positioning System, and embedded control systems, has significantly expanded their cybersecurity attack surface. Despite growing research efforts, a comprehensive understanding of the unique security challenges facing UAV systems remains fragmented. This survey systematically analyzes the multifaceted cybersecurity threats targeting UAV platforms, encompassing communication links, navigation subsystems, onboard controllers, and ground control stations. We develop a unified threat taxonomy that classifies attacks such as spoofing, jamming, denial-of-service, hijacking, and malware injection, and assess their impacts on the core security pillars of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Furthermore, existing defense mechanisms—including cryptographic protocols, intrusion detection systems, machine learning-based anomaly detection, secure routing algorithms, and authentication schemes—are critically evaluated with respect to their effectiveness, scalability, resource consumption, and suitability for UAV-specific operational constraints. Unlike previous surveys, this study synthesizes cross-layer defense strategies and highlights open research gaps that remain underexplored. Finally, emerging directions such as blockchain integration, federated learning, and quantum-resistant cryptographic frameworks are discussed, aiming to inspire robust and adaptive security architectures for next-generation UAV ecosystems. This survey offers valuable insights for researchers, system architects, and policymakers committed to advancing UAV cybersecurity in increasingly contested and dynamic environments. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

TI  - An improved DOA estimation method for direct sequence spread spectrum communication
AU  - Li, Han
AU  - Tong, Yanbin
AB  - Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation is a fundamental problem in array signal processing, with critical applications in radar, 5G communications, and unmanned aerial vehicle navigation. Traditional DOA algorithms, such as beamforming and subspace-based methods (e.g., MUSIC), face significant challenges when applied to spread spectrum signals, particularly Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), due to their wide bandwidth, low power spectral density, and pseudorandom modulation. These characteristics lead to dispersed signal energy and ambiguous phase information, severely degrading estimation accuracy. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel DOA estimation framework based on Canonical Polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition. By modeling the received array data as a third-order tensor (incorporating spatial, temporal, and code dimensions), CP decomposition effectively preserves the multilinear structure of the signal subspace, mitigating information loss inherent in conventional matrix-based approaches. The proposed method leverages the inherent robustness of DSSS signals against noise and multipath interference, enabling high-precision DOA estimation even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the classical MUSIC under spread spectrum communication scenario. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) performance improvement can be up to 3dB at low SNR. © 2025 IEEE.

AU  - Zhou, Jianwei

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been extensively utilized in both military and civilian domains due to their flexible flight capabilities and adaptability to complex terrains. However, in challenging environments such as forests, urban areas, and hostile settings with intentional jamming, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals often suffer from severe attenuation, jamming, and multipath effects, leading to significant degradation or even failure of UAV positioning performance. In particular, we consider multi-jamming environments, in which multiple spatially dispersed jammers operate simultaneously, further complicating signal reception. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel GNSS anti-jamming and hybrid positioning technique based on multi-UAV cooperation. The proposed method adopts a frequency-converting cooperative framework, integrating spatial anti-jamming techniques at the signal level with cooperative hybrid positioning algorithms at the data level. Specifically, a frequency-domain orthogonal subspace interference cancellation anti-jamming algorithm is developed, along with a least squares hybrid cooperative positioning method, to fully exploit the multi-node characteristics of the cooperative system, thereby improving spatial degrees of freedom and overall positioning performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the reliability and accuracy of GNSS positioning in multi-jamming environments. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

AB  - We examine a secure wireless communication system that is enabled by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in this research. In the wireless communication system with an eavesdropping UAV, we deploy a relay UAV to facilitate the transmission of confidential signals from the source station (denoted as S) to ground users. Additionally, we select an idle relay UAV to act as a cooperative jamming UAV, sending interference signals to the eavesdropping UAV. It is quite feasible that the eavesdropping UAV will leverage its mobility to improve the quality of its eavesdropping, making its trajectory unpredictable. First, to address the worst-case scenario for the ground user's security performance, we assume the eavesdropping UAV approaches at the closest distance.We aim to maximize the worst secrecy rate under perfect CSI via designing the flight trajectory and transmission power of both the relay UAV and the jamming UAV. Second, we investigated the performance of the system's secrecy outage probability under imperfect CSI. The presence of eavesdropping UAVs and the unpredictable nature of their environment makes traditional convex optimization methods mathematically complex for solving the trajectory optimization problem of the relay and jamming UAVs. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent joint design trajectory and power (MAJDTP) algorithm based on the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm to optimize the flight trajectory and transmission power of both UAVs. During the design and training process, the relay and jamming UAVs are treated as agents to derive their optimal flight paths and transmission energy. Finally, our approach surpasses the benchmark algorithm, as demonstrated by the simulation results. © IEEE. 2002-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Vision-based Self-Localization for UAVs Using Semantic Features and OpenStreetMap
AU  - Schmidt, Rebecca

AU  - Krause, Stefan
AU  - Schubert, Stefan
AB  - The autonomous operation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relies on reliable self-localization, which is typically achieved using global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). However, GNSS data can be unreliable due to effects of space weather phenomena or interference from GNSS jamming. To ensure accurate localization in such conditions, vision-based approaches for UAV positioning offer a potential alternative, though they often come with trade-offs in positioning accuracy or computational efficiency. In this paper, we present a real-time method for vision-based UAV self-localization that achieves GNSS-like accuracy. This approach involves extracting high-level semantic features from captured images and matching them to geo-referenced OpenStreetMap (OSM) data of the flight area. The global location of the UAV is then determined based on the matching results. We also compare and evaluate different metrics for measuring scene similarity to enhance the system's performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that even when OSM data is partially inaccurate, it can still be used to achieve accurate localization. This holds true even with a non-optimal neural network for segmentation and in environments with limited semantic features. The dataset used for evaluation will be made available with publication of this paper. © 2025 IEEE.

TI  - The Use of a Robotic Total Station for Verifying the Accuracy of UAV Navigation
AU  - Hubacek, Martin

AU  - Miarka, Daniel
AU  - Bajer, Josef
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly pivotal in both civil and military domains, frequently involving autonomous operations. High-precision navigation is crucial for accurate positioning. However, in military contexts, GNSS signals are susceptible to interference or spoofing. This study explores the potential of the Trimble S7 robotic total station for independent verification of UAV navigation system accuracy in environments with possible GNSS interference. The UAV platform 'Greenhorn' was utilized for testing. Two experiments were conducted: A static test to verify the accuracy of the UAV navigation system at fixed points, and a dynamic test to track the UAV along a predetermined path using the robotic total station, aimed at validating the proposed method's capabilities. The static test results indicated that the onboard UAV navigation system provides data consistent with the declared accuracy. The dynamic test results confirmed that the selected robotic total station is a suitable tool for independent verification of a flying UAV's position. However, altitude data deviations were observed during the dynamic test. Further experiments will be necessary to identify the causes of these deviations. The study substantiates the effectiveness of using a robotic total station for independent UAV position tracking and its potential application for verifying navigation system positions in training environments with electromagnetic interference prior to actual deployment UAV. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - During their work, UAV operators face many tasks that can be easily automated: takeoff, landing at a specific point, following a route at a given speed, and fixing the camera to a particular point during filming. Most of them have long been automated, but some still have a certain complexity such as distinguishing objects filmed by the UAV camera, navigation by coordinates, operating in difficult weather conditions, or during the operation of electronic warfare devices. The object of consideration in the article is the detection of objects in photos and videos obtained by aerial reconnaissance from UAVs. A working prototype for recognizing camouflaged objects in photos and videos obtained from aviation equipment was developed. The applied machine learning algorithms and neural networks allowed us to achieve high results in object recognition and increase the accuracy and speed of video analysis. The results of the model training process are investigated and presented graphically. The overall accuracy of the model reaches its maximum at a confidence level of 0.904, indicating that the model is very reliable at a high level of confidence. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Autonomous navigation entails using systems programmed to navigate predefined channels without human intervention. From driverless vehicles to RPAS (remotely piloted aircraft systems) and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), the introduction of autonomous navigation systems has revolutionised logistics, healthcare, aerospace, transportation, and numerous other industries. Traditionally, autonomous systems have relied on GPS (Global Positioning System) for accurate navigation and positioning with wide application in various autonomous systems, including precision-guided missiles, logistics and fleet management, and turn-by-turn navigation in driverless vehicles. While the introduction of GPS improved autonomous navigation significantly, it is not sufficiently reliable for fully autonomous navigation due to a reliance on external signals which are typically vulnerable to signal jamming and obstruction, interference, signal loss, and multipath errors. This limits the operations of autonomous navigation systems (ANSs) in GPS-denied environments where satellite or external signals are degraded, jammed, reflected, or obstructed. Consequently, environments without GPS availability render it impossible for ANSs to perform localisation swiftly and robustly while avoiding obstacles with no priori information of the location. This therefore also limits the systems' computation and perceptive capability. As such, applications and techniques that introduce disruptive technologies, such as machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, and sensor technology, have been developed to overcome some of these inherent limitations of GPS. This paper evaluates how the integration of such techniques facilitate ANSs in determining their relative positions in GPS-denied locations, ensuring operational efficiency and effective navigation. A combination of systematic literature reviews, descriptive analysis, and comparative analysis research methods is used to facilitate a comprehensive analysis and synthesis of relevant work and techniques used to overcome GPS-denied settings, as well as a comparison of these various techniques and their applications based on specific criteria-such as usability, efficiency, performance, and limitations-to identify the weaknesses and strengths of each method. © 2025 IEEE.

TI  - Method for Correcting Unreliable Readings of a GNSS Receiver When Using a Cost-Efficient Autopilot
AU  - Larin, Vitaliy Juriiovich Yu
AU  - Blazhei, Bohdan
T2  - Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems
AB  - This paper addresses a critical vulnerability in low-cost UAV autopilot systems in case of GNSS data unavailability, which can result from external interference or intentional spoofing. In the paper, we use a method that compensates for erroneous GNSS readings by substituting them with corrected signals derived from an external Inertial Navigation System (INS) combined with high-precision barometric altimeter measurements. The proposed approach integrates the inertial unit’s angular velocity and acceleration data using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF3) to generate accurate flight parameters that mimic the standard GNSS output, thereby ensuring reliable navigation. To validate this method, a series of field experiments were conducted using a VTOL UAV platform equipped with a HEX Cube Orange+ flight controller. During the test, an interference generator simulated false GNSS signals, causing significant deviations in altitude and position readings from the built-in GNSS receiver. In contrast, the INS-based system maintained a stable and accurate flight profile, as confirmed by telemetry data processed in MATLAB. Comparative analyses of flight altitude, groundspeed, and positional data clearly demonstrate the proposed method’s effectiveness in mitigating the impact of GNSS jamming. This work contributes to enhancing the safety and reliability of UAV operations in environments prone to GNSS interference. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Global navigation satellite system usage has led to a significant increase in air traffic. It also led to the emergence of new air traffic participants such as drones and urban air mobility. One of the major weaknesses of the global navigation satellite system is its vulnerability to interference and spoofing. This is particularly dangerous for both manned and unmanned aerial vehicles. One of the methods of mitigating interference is the Advanced Interference Monitoring and Mitigation technology (AIM+). This technology protects against simple narrow-band interference as well as more complex wide-band interference, including jamming and spoofing. This paper presents the results of experimental testing of this technology. We investigated the accuracy and availability of the navigation solution when the navigation receiver is operating under the influence of interference. Three types of navigation antennas were used in this research. The research results are presented in text and graphical form. The conclusions regarding the use of the studied technology were made. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has fundamentally changed the concept of operations (CONOPS) for aerial platforms, including loitering munitions, counter-UAS (CUAS) platforms, smart munitions, and surveillance drones. As a result, the need for autonomous operation has been accelerated. To counter the effectiveness of low-cost attritables, combatants have fielded highly effective radio frequency (RF) techniques for jamming radio communications and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) navigation systems. This has created a need for fully autonomous platforms, relying on passive technologies, that can operate in today’s contested battlefield and achieve the intended tactical results. While for many situational awareness applications, generalized target class detectors may be adequate, effectors require fine-grained classification of targets and aim-point classifiers to ensure successful target engagement. This drives the need for high-resolution, multi-spectral training data of foreign military targets. Today, a chasm exists in the data needed to train seekers. Teledyne has pioneered the use of synthetic data to create effective targeting solutions where little to no real data is available. © 2025 SPIE. All rights reserved.

T2  - IEEE Internet of Things Journal
AB  - Precise navigation signals are essential for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to achieve accurate positioning and task execution. However, global positioning system (GPS) signals are highly vulnerable to spoofing and jamming attacks, posing serious threats to flight safety. Therefore, this article proposes an intelligent detection algorithm based on federated learning (FL) for identifying spoofing and jamming signals in UAV navigation. First, the algorithm innovatively integrates the local feature extraction ability of the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and the global dependency modeling advantage of the Transformer network, constructing a TCN-Transformer model to capture the features of navigation data efficiently. Second, a distributed construction network is adopted, where weight aggregation and updates are performed via FL, enabling global optimization without data sharing. Furthermore, an accuracy-weighted aggregation strategy is introduced, dynamically assigning weights based on the detection performance of each client mode. This encourages contributions of high-quality data and computational resources, thereby enhancing the overall model performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional algorithms in detecting navigation spoofing and jamming, offering superior detection accuracy and robustness. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Intelligent transportation systems, including autonomous vehicles, require precise and reliable navigation and positioning systems to ensure safety. However, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations are degraded by signal interference, such as obstructions and reflections from high-rise buildings. Navigation methods struggle to effectively process GNSS outliers caused by multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception in urban environments under changing scenarios. To address this issue, this study proposes a robust factor graph optimization (FGO) approach based on a flexible strategy. Initially, a quality evaluation method utilizing the Mahalanobis distance of pseudorange residual test statistics is developed, enabling smooth and dynamic adjustment of the measurement fusion weights for each satellite. Furthermore, by integrating both satellite quantity and quality data, a flexible strategy is proposed that fully accounts for the differences in measurement quality and the reference values of each satellite across different scenarios. This integration with the navigation environment improves the robustness of the tightly coupled navigation system. Three vehicle-mounted experiments in urban canyon environments were conducted, and the results indicate that, compared to conventional methods, the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of horizontal positioning were reduced by 13.24%, 26.06%, and 33.92%, respectively. The proposed method effectively mitigates the impact of GNSS outliers and enhances the reliability of GNSS-based navigation systems for applications such as autonomous vehicles, uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), and urban transportation systems. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Much of the prior work studying multipath interference and Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) reception literature studies precise pseudorange error estimation and/or improving a navigation filter's performance in urban canyon environments. This paper instead studies statistical behaviors of pseudorange errors caused by multipath interference and NLOS reception. The error statistics are observed through histograms of known-NLOS measurements collected by a vehicle-mounted commercial Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver traveling through a city center. The histograms formed from known-Line of Sight (LOS) measurements generally maintain a zero-mean bias and Gaussian shape, while the histograms from known-NLOS measurements exhibit both greater bias and heavier tails as the canyon depth increases. The histograms show that the NLOS measurements also suffer greater errors in canyons with similar depth on both sides as compared to canyons where the depth of one side is significantly greater. As modern state estimators often incorporate statistical error models to fuse measurements, these specific results offer insights into how to select statistical error models that better match the Radio Frequency (RF) environment which urban GNSS receivers experience. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) navigation is crucial in the operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). GNSS signals are susceptible to jamming due to their low received power, and vulnerable to spoofing because the civilian signals are typically unencrypted. In addition, multipath and urban canyons can degrade positioning accuracy. An alternative to GNSS in the event that it is unavailable is desirable. Terrestrial cellular signals are a promising option to use for navigation because they are continuously transmitted at higher power levels. Optimizing hardware size, weight, and power (SWaP) is critical for UAVs to maximize endurance, payload capacity, and operational effi-ciency. This paper develops a technique to measure a differential pseudorange between an LTE cell tower and a mobile receiver using a low-SWaP, low-cost software defined radio. This paper also implements an extended Kalman filter to fuse differential pseudorange and inertial measurement unit (IMU) measurements to estimate the trajectory of the mobile receiver. This approach was validated through a flight test with 8.03 m root mean square error (RMSE) on the estimated trajectory. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - Quadrotor UAVs are widely used in various fields due to their simple airframe structure and high maneuverability. With the complexity of the flight mission, higher control requirements are put forward for the quadrotor UAV system. In this paper, firstly, a complete mathematical model of quadrotor UAV is established, and secondly, a specified time controller with the advantages of fast convergence speed and high control accuracy is designed. In order to improve the convergence speed, the design method of the specified time controller based on disturbance observer is proposed for the attitude loop.

TI  - An Efficient Hybrid Spoofing/Spot-jamming Strategy on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
AU  - Ballouk, Abdo

AU  - Alhariri, Mohamad
T2  - International Journal of Sensors, Wireless Communications and Control
AB  - Background: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) pose significant security risks to critical infrastructures, potentially leading to accidents, attacks, or illicit surveillance. Robust prevention measures are essential around strategic facilities. The navigation and control of UAV systems fundamentally depend on the Global Positioning System (GPS). Consequently, jamming or spoofing the GPS navigation system can significantly hinder the control and direct UAVs to their specified destinations. This paper introduces a novel hybrid spoofing/spot jamming system aimed at fortifying security against UAV threats. Objectives: This study aims to propose and evaluate the efficiency of a hybrid spoofing/spot-jamming system to bolster security against UAVs. Methods: Leveraging a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) and complementary software tools, we generated spoofing and jamming signals targeting the civilian-use signals of GPS satellites at the L1 frequency (1575.42 MHz), incorporating the Coarse Acquisition (C/A) code. The system enables flexible timing adjustments within the navigation message to simulate fictitious locations. Results: Through comprehensive testing involving multiple commercial UAVs across three distinct scenarios—reactive spoofing, proactive spoofing, and spot jamming followed by spoofing—the experiments demonstrated superior efficacy in proactive spoofing and spot jamming followed by GPS spoofing, compared to reactive spoofing alone. Conclusion: Proactive spoofing and spot jamming, followed by GPS spoofing, emerge as more effective strategies for countering UAV threats, offering enhanced security measures for critical infrastructures vulnerable to UAV intrusions. This hybrid approach holds promise in augmenting existing defense mechanisms against evolving UAV-based security risks. © 2025 Bentham Science Publishers.

T2  - Periodica Polytechnica Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
AB  - Assisting elderly individuals in indoor environments is crucial, as they often encounter mobility and safety challenges. Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) navigation offers a transformative solution, significantly enhancing safety, efficiency, and quality of life. These UAVs can perform tasks such as monitoring, delivering essential items, and responding to emergencies, providing invaluable support and promoting greater independence for elderly individuals. To achieve effective assistance, autonomous UAV navigation relies on robust path planning with obstacle avoidance to ensure optimal performance. A newly developed path planning, based on a new hybrid Water Cycle Algorithm (WCA), stands out by addressing the challenge of avoiding obstacles while adhering to non-holonomic constraints and conserving energy in complex, cluttered indoor environments. In Population-Based Algorithms (PBAs), the initial population plays a crucial role, as it greatly impacts the algorithm's efficiency in exploring the search space and its rate of convergence. The new developed hybrid algorithm, called WCA-HS, is based on using the Harmony Search (HS) algorithm to identify the optimal initial population for the WCA. The results indicate that the hybrid WCA-HS outperforms classical WCA and other metaheuristic algorithms, such as HS, Firefly Algorithm (FA), Cuckoo Search (CS), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), over 20 independent runs, highlighting the effectiveness of the population initialization technique. Additionally, the developed indoor path planning system was evaluated in highly cluttered and low-light environments, showcasing its robustness and real-world applicability, making it highly effective for assisting elderly individuals in complex indoor environments. © 2025 Budapest University of Technology and Economics.

AB  - Drones play a crucial role in civil engineering tasks such as logistics and data collection. While existing autonomous drone research focuses on safe path planning in static environments, urban navigation remains a challenge due to dynamic factors like wind disturbances, complex building layouts, and signal interference. Traditional autonomous navigation methods struggle in urban settings, where wind variations, GPS limitations, and unpredictable obstacles affect flight stability. Most existing approaches rely on extensive external data sources, increasing computational complexity. Therefore, an efficient, sensor-based solution is required to enable drones to navigate dynamic wind zones with real-time adaptability and high precision. This study introduces a Residual Group Adaptive Dual-Channel Pulse-Coupled Neural Network with Cat Hunting Optimization (RGADCPCNNet-CHO), which leverages local RGB camera and GPS data to enhance drone navigation without relying on external inputs. The framework integrates Window-Aware Guided Image Filtering (WGBF) to refine GPS-estimated wind force with RGB camera data, while a Cswin Transformer extracts features such as obstacles, wind drift, velocity, and position. The RGADCPCNNet handles path planning, and Cat Hunting Optimization (CHO) optimizes hyperparameters for better adaptability. The proposed model achieves 99.15% accuracy, 99.14% recalls, 0.99 explained variance ratio (EVA), and a low RMSE of 0.41, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - Space-air-ground networks have received a lot of attention due to its extensive coverage characteristics. However, it also faces many unprecedented security challenges. This paper considers a space-air-ground network with an airship acting as an eavesdropper. To counter the eavesdropping threat, the unmanned aerial vehicle transmits artificial noise to jam the eavesdropper. We first consider the scenario without the no-fly zone, to maximize the system secrecy energy efficiency. Specifically, we formulate it into a fractional programming optimization problem, which jointly optimizes the UAV trajectory design and the jamming power, and then decompose it into two subproblems, i.e., trajectory-related and power-related subproblems. To derive the solution, we employ Dinkelbach algorithm, successive convex approximation algorithm, and the method of introducing slack variables to convert the non-convex subproblems into convex forms. The convergence of the developed algorithm and the complexity of our proposed scheme are analytically evaluated. Moreover, we consider the scenario with a no-fly zone and derive the solution. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can effectively improve the system secrecy energy efficiency. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Autonomous aerial refueling (AAR) enables extended mission endurance for both manned and unmanned aircraft without relying on ground-based support. Traditional AAR methods use active sensors such as radar and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), which are susceptible to jamming and interference. This paper investigates a passive, vision-based approach using You Only Look Once (YOLO) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and track refueling components using only monocular imagery. Two flight test campaigns were conducted to evaluate system performance: one using a scalemodel aircraft and the other using full-scale aircraft. The results demonstrate that larger objects like tankers can be accurately tracked at greater distances, while smaller objects like drogues require closer proximity for reliable pose estimation. A method leveraging a separate network for tanker tracking provides azimuth and elevation cues, guiding the receiver toward the drogue until it is close enough for precise docking. Additionally, extensive flight imagery was collected for future validation using recorded Global Positioning System (GPS) data. These findings highlight the feasibility of vision-based AAR and inform future work toward a fully autonomous refueling capability. © 2025 IEEE.

T2  - IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics
AB  - Trusted navigation is paramount for the safe operation and mission success of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complex environments. However, individual navigation systems possess inherent limitations. For example, global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) are vulnerable to signal denial, spoofing, and jamming attacks, whereas inertial navigation systems suffer from cumulative error growth that ultimately degrades navigation accuracy. To overcome these challenges, this article proposes a novel multisource fusion navigation framework tailored for UAVs operating under adverse conditions. First, we introduce a mechanical antenna (MA)-based positioning method as a complementary solution to GNSS unavailable. The MA, mounted on the UAV, transmits low-frequency magnetic field signals captured by ground-based magnetic sensors; subsequently, a particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed for MA positioning. Recognizing that near-field magnetic interference adversely affects MA accuracy, we further integrate an anomaly detection mechanism with dynamic adaptive fusion and federated filtering algorithms, respectively, to isolate data from compromised sensors. Comprehensive experimental evaluations, including UAV flights under GNSS spoofing attacks, demonstrate that the proposed fusion approach not only effectively detects various sensor attacks (achieving average accuracy and precision of 99.7% and 98.7%, respectively), but also maintains trusted navigation in GNSS-challenged and magnetically interfered environments. © 1996-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are efficient tools for diverse tasks such as electronic reconnaissance, agricultural operations and disaster relief. In the complex three-dimensional (3D) environments, the path planning with obstacle avoidance for UAVs is a significant issue for security assurance. In this paper, we construct a comprehensive 3D scenario with obstacles and no-fly zones for dynamic UAV trajectory. Moreover, a novel artificial potential field algorithm coupled with simulated annealing (APF-SA) is proposed to tackle the robust path planning problem. APF-SA modifies the attractive and repulsive potential functions and leverages simulated annealing to escape local minimum and converge to globally optimal solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the effectiveness of APFSA, enabling efficient autonomous path planning for UAVs with obstacle avoidance. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - A distributed cooperative navigation method based on absolute modelling is proposed for the navigation problem of low-cost UAV swarms in GNSS signal interference areas. This method leverages ranging information and a 9-dimensional state model to achieve precise positioning and configuration maintenance of the swarm, even with a small number of anchor nodes. A particle-based measure noise estimation method is introduced to address errors caused by linearization when considering the uncertainty of neighboring nodes’ positions. Simulation results demonstrate that, with the assistance of the cooperative mechanism, the absolute position error of a general node is reduced to 5.89 m and the relative distance error to 0.87 m. Furthermore, the particle-based measure noise estimation method improves absolute and relative navigation accuracy by 37.21% and 25.00%, respectively. The proposed method offers low cost, minimal data transmission, and is well-suited for engineering applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.

AB  - Urban air mobility (UAM) aims at transporting passengers or cargo in urban and suburban areas using electric vertical take-off and landing aircrafts (eVTOLs) in low altitude airspace. A reliable and resilient navigation system is essential to the safe operation of UAM applications. The take-off and landing at vertiports is arguably the most challenging phase of operation for the navigation system due to the stringent performance requirements and the complex environment in urban areas. Cameras can be applied as an alternative navigation sensor to GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and other radiobased navigation systems at vertiports due to its resilience against radio interference and high accuracy at low altitudes. However, the integrity quantification and monitoring of camera-based navigation remains a challenging topic, blocking visual navigation methods from being certified for safety critical applications. In this work, an integrity framework is proposed for applying camera-based positioning during take-off and landing operations at vertiports. © 2025 IEEE.

AU  - Zheng, Ning
AU  - Xu, Yan
AU  - Cai, Kaiquan
AU  - Inalhan, Gokhan
AB  - This paper proposes a dynamic airspace corridor planning method based on a complex urban digital twin model. The method fully considers multiple environmental factors such as urban microclimate variations, signal interference, temporary no-fly zones and building density. It can generate highly accurate gridded airspace information in real time, enabling safe and efficient airspace corridor planning for large-scale, high-density and dynamically changing multi-UAV cooperative operations. This study adopts a divide-and-conquer approach that combines fluid models, the A∗ path planning algorithm, and Laplace equation solving to construct adaptive, obstacle-avoiding, high-density airspace corridors within hierarchical subregions. Through refined airspace zoning control and dynamic optimization, the system strictly enforces safety intervals throughout the planning process, ensuring the minimum safety distance between corridors and minimising the potential collision risks between UAVs. The proposed dynamic airspace corridor planning method has been evaluated in a randomly generated environment and an urban digital twin model. Experimental results show that even in complex urban environments with dense high-rise buildings and drastic wind speed variations, the method can still quickly construct a feasible airspace corridor network. In addition, using a graph-theory based local optimisation algorithm, the method can achieve dynamic, seamless interconnection of multi-segment airspace corridors and flexibly adjust deployment strategies for redundant corridors. In the event of emergencies or drastic environmental changes, these redundant corridors can serve as emergency bypass routes, ensuring that UAVs can avoid obstacles and safely maintain continuous flight © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - The rapid increase in the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAV) across various critical sectors, such as defense, underscores the urgent need to address their vulnerability to GPS-based interference. This project examines the dual threats of GPS spoofing and jamming, both of which can significantly undermine the integrity and reliability of drone operations. Spoofing misleads the flight controller by manipulating location data causing the drone to believe it is operating in a different location than its actual position, while Jamming disrupts communication with satellite signals, making navigation systems ineffective. Utilizing a Cube Orange with Pixhawk, HackRF One, Here3+ GPS, and a custom- built VCO-based RF jammer, this study examines the se- rious implications of these threats on drone stability and functionality. The project follows a systematic approach, starting with the careful assembly and calibration of a custom quadcopter. By employing gps-sdr-sim software and HackRF One, realistic spoofing signals were created to manipulate GPS telemetry, while a custom-designed jammer circuit, developed in Altium Designer, showcased the ability to disable navigation systems completely. Testing and validation were carried out using Mission Planner and QGroundControl, revealing that spoofing could convincingly change the drone’s perceived location, resulting in incorrect behavior, while jamming led to immediate operational failure. © 2025 IEEE.

TI  - "Lure the Enemy in Deep": Confronting Rogue UAV Through Diverse Hybrid Jamming
AU  - Ma, Xiaomeng
AU  - Gao, Meiguo
T2  - IEEE Access
AB  - This research addresses the challenge in capturing rogue uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) strategies based on communication and navigation jamming technology in the absence of observable UAV communication performance parameters. The jamming involves remote communication suppressing (RCS) power control, as well as navigation suppressing (NS) and navigation deception (ND) combination, hence named as the diverse Hybrid jamming (DHJ) strategy. Firstly, we construct the DHJ model, which analyzes the dynamic impact mechanism of DHJ on UAV flight control systems based on common control protocols. Subsequently, we introduce the concept of the Situation Estimation Ring (SER) to overcome reward-driven deficiencies arising from incomplete observation and optimize features of the state space, which essentially considers the flight status feedback mechanism of the UAV to DHJ attacks and will be used to construct the DHJ Markov Decision Process (DHJ-MDP) mathematical framework. Then, the DHJ attack process against UAV is formulated as a game framework, where the counter-UAV system (CUS) generates DHJ strategy solely based on spatial positional states to deceive and capture the UAV, and the UAV adopts flight control strategies to evade jamming based on communication quality and navigation positioning information. Finally, the analysis of Nash equilibrium (NE) properties explain that the SER-based dynamic spatial positioning of UAV can be used for CUS to derive DHJ equilibrium strategies, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for solving these strategies using knowledge-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, with the algorithm's complexity also being proven. Simulation and comparison experiments demonstrate that the solved DHJ strategy effectively drives UAV toward deceptive destinations under incomplete observation states, achieve the 'lure the enemy in deep' effect and the proposed SER-base algorithms enhances algorithm's convergence speed. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper explores the application of the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) for model training to control UAV swarms in dynamic and adversarial scenarios. Using a modified Pac-Man environment, Pac-Man represents a target UAV, and Ghosts represents the UAV swarm that counteracts it. The grid-based representation of Pac-Man mazes is used as an abstraction of a two-dimensional terrain model, which serves as a plane of pathways with obstacles that correspond to the UAV flight conditions a t a certain altitude. The proposed approach provides a clear discretization of space, simplifying pathfinding, collision avoidance, and the planning ofreconnaissance or interception routes by combining decentralized local autonomy with centralized training, which enables UAVs to coordinate effectively and quickly adapt to changing conditions. This study evaluates the performance ofMADDPG-trained model-controlled adversaries against heuristic navigation strategies, such as A* and Breadth-First Search (BFS). Traditional Rule-Based Pursuit and Prediction Algorithms inspired by the behaviors of Blinky and Pinky ghosts from the classic Pac-Man game are included as benchmarks to assess the impact of learning-based methods. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of MADDPG-trained models in enhancing UAV swarm control by analyzing its adaptability and coordination capabilities in adversarial environments by computer modeling in simplified missions-like 2D environments. Experiments conducted across varying levels of terrain complexity revealed that MADDPG-trained model demonstrated superior adaptability and strategic coordination compared to the rule-based methods. Ghosts controlled by a model trained via MADDPG significantly reduce the success rate of Pac-Man agents, particularly in highly constrained environments, emphasizing the potential oflearning-based adversarial strategies in UAV applications such as urban navigation, defense, and surveillance. Conclusions. MADDPG is a promising robust framework for training models to control UAV swarms, particularly in adversarial settings. This study highlights its adaptability and ability to outperform traditional rule-based methods in dynamic and complex environments. Future research should focus on comparing the effectiveness of MADDPG-trained models with multi-agent algorithms, such as Expectimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), to further understand the advantages and limitations of learning-based approaches compared with traditional decision-making methods in collaborative and adversarial UAV operations. Additionally, the exploration of 3D implementations, integrating maze height decomposition and flight restrictions, as well as incorporating cybersecurity considerations and real-world threats like anti-drone systems and electronic warfare, will enhance the robustness and applicability ofthese methods in realistic UAV scenarios. © (2025), (National Aerospace University Kharkiv Aviation Institute).

AB  - The low-altitude economy provides new opportunities for target search, as autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) improve search efficiency through aerial surveillance and data collection. AAVs support overhead views of the search area, while ground vehicles (GVs) offer side views, facilitating effective collaboration in wireless networks. However, the limited battery life restrict AAVs from performing computation-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks, and their wireless communication links are susceptible to jamming attacks. Therefore, this letter proposes a joint resource scheduling approach for an edge computing enabled multi-AAV multi-GV cooperative target search system under intelligent jamming attacks. Specifically, the approach aims to minimize the uncertainty of the search area by jointly optimizing ground base station (GBS) association, task offloading rate, and 3D trajectory control. Since the problem is non-convex and the intelligent jamming behavior is dynamic, a multi-agent softmax deep double deterministic policy gradients (MA-SD3) approach is proposed to effectively perform resource management for target search and resist jamming attacks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline approaches under different settings. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are fundamental in ubiquitously providing position and time to a wide gamut of systems. Jamming remains a realistic threat in many deployment settings, civilian and tactical. Specifically, in drones sustained denial raises safety critical concerns. This work presents a strategy that allows detection, localization, and classification both in the frequency and time domain of interference signals harmful to navigation. A high-performance Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) drone with a single antenna and a commercial GNSS receiver is used to geolocate and characterize RF emitters at long range, to infer the navigation impairment. Raw IQ baseband snapshots from the GNSS receiver make the application of spectral correlation methods possible without extra software-defined radio payload, paving the way to spectrum identification and monitoring in airborne platforms, aiming at RF situational awareness. Live testing at Jammertest, in Norway, with portable, commercially available GNSS multi-band jammers demonstrates the ability to detect, localize, and characterize harmful interference. Our system pinpointed the position with an error of a few meters of the transmitter and the extent of the affected area at long range, without entering the denied zone. Additionally, further spectral content extraction is used to accurately identify the jammer frequency, bandwidth, and modulation scheme based on spectral correlation techniques. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

TI  - Finite-time trajectory tracking control of quadrotor UAVs based on neural network disturbance observer and command filter
AU  - Li, Boning

T2  - International Journal of Systems Science
AB  - The paper proposes a novel finite-time control strategy for quadrotor UAV trajectory tracking using a neural network disturbance observer and a command filter. This method is used to address input saturation and disturbances, ensuring that the UAV can accurately follow the desired trajectory in finite time. The neural network disturbance observer is crucial for approximating external disturbance signals within a finite time, while the finite-time backstepping scheme accelerates the convergence of tracking errors. The command filtering technique is employed to avoid the complex derivation of virtual control laws, simplifying the controller design. The importance of this method lies in its ability to achieve fast, disturbance-resistant trajectory tracking for UAVs, making the control system more robust in practical applications. Simulations were conducted, showing that the proposed control strategy enables the quadrotor UAV to track its desired trajectory effectively, with improved anti-jamming capability. Both filtering and observation errors converged to the equilibrium point, validating the effectiveness of the approach. However, internal factors like actuator failure were not considered, pointing to future work in refining the method and applying it in real-world UAV experiments. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

T2  - Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering
AB  - In order to meet the needs of informationized warfare, overcoming the electromagnetic compatibility of combat platforms, as well as the integration of multifunctional electronic systems with greatly improved combat performance, has become the future direction of weapons and equipment development. Mission planning methods for electronic systems need to maximize system performance under limited resource conditions, but due to the complexity of multi-task planning, existing mission planning methods often lead to significant performance degradation in real-world operations as the number of tasks increases. In order to resolve the issues raised above, based on a deep reinforcement learning approach to multi-task planning, we propose a trajectory optimization problem for solving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) trajectories when they fly to multiple designated regions to perform tasks. For multi-task planning, this paper takes the above trajectory optimization problem as an entry point and employs the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to compute the best planning results of this system under the constraints of limited resource conditions. Simulation results indicate that the planning algorithm used in the paper has significant advantages in improving comprehensive performance of this system compared to traditional task planning methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are critical to the military and have enormous potential for expansion, but they are vulnerable to jamming on the battlefield, reducing the quality of communication links and operational effectiveness. Low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites can be used as auxiliary communication nodes to enhance the communication stability of UAV networks in a complex electromagnetic environment. Therefore, in this paper, we establish a model of a LEO satellite-assisted UAV network in a spectrum denial environment. We propose a routing optimization algorithm based on simulated annealing to improve communication quality through route planning and a reasonable allocation of network bandwidth resources.

AB  - This study explores the use of electronic countermeasures to disrupt communications systems in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), focusing on the protection of airspaces and critical infrastructures such as airports and power stations. The research aims to develop a low-cost, adaptable jamming device using Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology, targeting key UAV communication links, including geolocation, radio control, and video transmission. It applies jamming techniques that successfully disrupt UAV communications. GPS spoofing techniques were also implemented, with both static and dynamic spoofing tested to mislead the drones’ navigation systems. Dynamic spoofing, combined with no-fly zone enforcement, proved to be particularly effective in forcing drones to land or exhibit erratic behavior. The conclusions of this study highlight the effectiveness of these techniques in neutralizing unauthorized UAVs, while also identifying the need for future research in countering drones that operate on alternative frequencies, such as 4G/5G, to enhance the system’s robustness in evolving drone environments. © 2024 by the authors.

T2  - Smart Agricultural Technology
AB  - Agrivoltaic systems, which integrate solar energy production with agricultural practices, present a sustainable solution to optimize land use. However, specific configurations, such as overhead solar panels, can obstruct Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, which are vital for precision agriculture technologies. This study investigates the impact of an agrivoltaic system on GNSS signal performance compared to a conventional orchard in Kressbronn am Bodensee, Germany, using data from multiple GNSS constellations (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou). Key metrics such as carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/N₀), positional accuracy, time to first fix (TTFF), and dilution of precision (DOP) were analyzed. The results showed significant signal degradation under the overhead agrivoltaic system, particularly in C/N₀ and positional accuracy. While there were no significant differences in DOP metrics or TTFF, the average C/N₀ decreased from 30.62 dB-Hz in the conventional orchard to 26.92 dB-Hz in the agrivoltaic system. Moreover, the average of satellites with C/N₀ values below 24 dB-Hz was notably higher in the agrivoltaic area, indicating critical signal degradation. In addition, relying on a single constellation, like GPS, may not provide enough satellites for reliable GNSS performance. Despite the lower signal quality, the average number of satellites with C/N₀ above 24 dB-Hz remained over 22 in both areas. Combined with slight or no significant differences in other metrics compared to the conventional orchard, this suggests GNSS-based systems can support precision agriculture tasks within the agrivoltaic environment. The study highlights the importance of addressing signal interference to avoid hindering the integration of drones, robots, and other advanced technologies in agrivoltaics management, and suggests alternative solutions, such as Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) correction or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, to enhance performance. These findings are critical as agrivoltaic adoption grows, requiring a balance between solar energy production and the operational needs of precision agriculture. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Accurate geolocation using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is essential for safe and long-range unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flights. However, GNSS systems are susceptible to blockages, jamming, and spoofing attacks. Localization using onboard cameras and satellite images provides a promising solution for UAVs operating in GNSS-denied environments. In this paper, we developed a novel UAV visual localization system for GNSS-denied situations, both day and night, that integrates image matching, visual odometry (VO), and terrain-weighted constraint optimization. First, an effective map management strategy is designed for satellite image chunking, real-time scheduling, and merging. Then, a 2D–3D geo-registration method, combining Bidirectional Homologous Points Search, is introduced to obtain accurate 3D virtual control points for UAV absolute localization. Lastly, a position estimation and optimization method, integrating the sliding window with terrain weighting constraints, is proposed to control position error accumulation and reduce position drift. Twenty experiments were conducted in typical and complex scenarios to validate our system's resilience to altitude changes, trajectory variations, and rolling terrain. Our system demonstrated drift-free and viewpoint-robust, maintaining stability even in feature-poor environments and seasonal variations. It does not require loop closure, allowing for re-localization after positioning failures. Additionally, we utilized thermal infrared images to demonstrate the system's performance in night-time conditions. With a Mean Absolute Error of less than 7 m, it can be a powerful complement to GNSS in the event of GNSS-Denied environments.

AB  - Emergency communication network (ECN) can provide fast, efficient and high-capacity communication services for specific areas by using mmWave transmission and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) serving as aerial base stations (ABSs) or relay nodes. Now, in order to satisfy diverse demands, ECN should support different types of nodes, access methods, and traffic distributions, which is referred to as heterogeneous ECN (HetECN). Therefore, inappropriate trajectory planning and unbalanced traffic loading can lead to UAV flight collisions and network congestion. In this article, we jointly optimize UAV jamming avoidance trajectory and user association strategy aimed to load balancing, to maximize the utilization of HetECN. Specifically, an improved artificial potential field (APF) method along with mmWave beam forming technology is used to obtain the jamming avoidance trajectory of UAVs, and the optimal deployment location of UAVs are determined based on the distribution of ground users (GUs). Subsequently, the matching game and alliance game are comprehensively used to determine the load balancing based GU-UAV associated strategy under various GU demands, thereby ensuring traffic load balancing and resource optimization allocation. In addition, altitude fine-tuning have been made to further power consumption, thereby improving overall network efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve the expected performance in network utilities such as coverage rate, network capacity, load balancing effect of mmWave UAV-assisted HetECNs. © 2024 The Authors

T2  - Scientific Reports
AB  - This study presents a novel framework that integrates the universal jamming gripper (UG) with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to enable automated grasping with no human operator in the loop. Grounded in the principles of granular jamming, the UG exhibits remarkable adaptability and proficiency, navigating the complexities of soft aerial grasping with enhanced robustness and versatility. Central to this integration is a uniquely formulated constrained trajectory optimization using model predictive control, coupled with a robust force control strategy, increasing the level of automation and operational reliability in aerial grasping. This control structure, while simple, is a powerful tool for various applications, ranging from material handling to disaster response, and marks an advancement toward genuine autonomy in aerial manipulation tasks. The key contribution of this research is the combination of a UG with a suitable control strategy, that can be kept relatively straightforward thanks to the mechanical intelligence built into the UG. The algorithm is validated through numerical simulations and virtual experiments. © The Author(s) 2024.

T2  - Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may be subjected to unintentional radio frequency interference (RFI) or hostile jamming attack which will lead to fail to track global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals. Therefore, the simultaneous realization of anti-jamming and high-precision carrier phase difference positioning becomes a dilemmatic problem. In this paper, a distortionless phase digital beamforming (DBF) algorithm with self-calibration antenna arrays is proposed, which enables to obtain distortionless carrier phase while suppressing jamming. Additionally, architecture of high precision Beidou receiver based on anti-jamming antenna arrays is proposed. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated, including antenna calibration accuracy, carrier phase distortionless accuracy, and carrier phase measurement accuracy without jamming. Meanwhile, the maximal jamming to signal ratio (JSR) and real time kinematic (RTK) positioning accuracy under wideband jamming are also investigated. The experimental results based on the real-life Beidou signals show that the proposed method has an excellent performance for precise relative positioning under jamming when compared with other anti-jamming methods. © 2024 Beijing Institute of Aerospace Information.

AB  - On the modern battlefield, Global Positioning System (GPS) can be unreliable in contested environments due to jamming or signal loss. Existing alternatives like high-accuracy inertial navigation systems (INS) are prone to higher drifts over distances with platform dependent performance, while solutions like Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) and Lidar-Inertial Odometry (LIO) lack accuracy and robustness on challenging terrain. We present a novel Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) solution that overcomes these limitations. It integrates inertial measurements from an IMU and doppler measurements from a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) LiDAR within a non-linear filtering framework to robustly measure motion states that achieve up to 0.1% Cross Track Error (CTE) rate in real-time. Furthermore, unlike solutions reliant on wheel speed sensors, our method requires no platform-specific information and is resilient to environmental factors such as wheel-slip, dynamic lighting, and weather conditions. This makes it highly portable, scalable, dependable, and readily deployable on a diverse set of platforms like ground vehicles, low-altitude drones, and even dismounted soldiers. Compared to traditional Time-of-Flight (ToF) LiDAR systems that operate in the Near Infrared (NIR) spectrum, FMCW LiDARs offer lower detectability due to their operation at lower peak power and within the Short-wave Infrared (SWIR) spectrum. In the face of increasing GPS disruptions and the proliferation of autonomy in military applications, our method provides a dependable solution for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) in a broad variety of challenging scenarios. © Rights reserved by the National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA) Michigan Chapter, authors and their respected organizations.

AB  - As Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly integral to a variety of industries, their dependency on radio frequency (RF) signal-based communication systems has exposed them to a multitude of security vulnerabilities. One of the most notable ones is RF jamming, which can disrupt communication, control, and navigation. While traditional countermeasures, such as Hardware Sandboxing \citemead_defeating_2016, or Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on Deep Learning aim to mitigate these threats, they exhibit limitations in addressing sophisticated jamming attacks \citedhomane_counter_measures_2020-1. This paper presents a novel design of an authentication-based strategy using RF watermarking. Our proposed RF watermarking technique embeds hidden identifiers within RF signals to authenticate communication sources and detect jamming attempts. Through a comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in enhancing UAV communication security and ensuring reliable operation in the presence of adversarial interference. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are competent to perform a variety of applications, possessing great potential and promise. The deep neural networks (DNN) technology has enabled the UAV-assisted paradigm, accelerated the construction of smart cities, and propelled the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). UAVs play an increasingly important role in various applications, such as surveillance, environmental monitoring, emergency rescue, and supplies delivery, for which a robust path-planning technique is the foundation and prerequisite. However, existing methods lack comprehensive consideration of the complicated urban environment and do not provide an overall assessment of the robustness and generalization. Meanwhile, due to the resource constraints and hardware limitations of UAVs, the complexity of deploying the network needs to be reduced. This article proposes a lightweight, reinforcement-learning-based (RL-based) real-time path-planning method for UAVs, adaptive SAC (ASAC) algorithm, which optimizing the training process, network architecture, and algorithmic models. First of all, we establish a framework of global training and local adaptation, where the structured environment model is constructed for interaction, and local dynamically varying information aids in improving generalization. Second, ASAC introduces a cross-layer connection approach that passes the original state information into the higher layers to avoid feature loss and improve learning efficiency. Finally, we propose an adaptive temperature coefficient, which flexibly adjusts the exploration probability of UAVs with the training phase and experience data accumulation. In addition, a series of comparison experiments have been conducted in conjunction with practical application requirements, and the results have fully proved the favorable superiority of ASAC. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in military, medical, wireless communications, aerial surveillance, etc. One key topic involving UAVs is pose estimation in autonomous navigation. A standard procedure for this process is to combine inertial navigation system sensor information with the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signal. However, some factors can interfere with the GNSS signal, such as ionospheric scintillation, jamming, or spoofing. One alternative method to avoid using the GNSS signal is to apply an image processing approach by matching UAV images with georeferenced images. But a high effort is required for image edge extraction. In this paper, a support vector regression (SVR) model is proposed to reduce this computational load and processing time. The dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) of part of the SVR datapath is implementated to accelerate the process, reduce the area, and analyze its granularity by increasing the grain size of the reconfigurable region. Results show that the implementation in hardware is 68 times faster than that in software. This architecure with DPR also facilitates the low power consumption of 4 ​mW, leading to a reduction of 57% than that without DPR. This is also the lowest power consumption in current machine learning hardware implementations. Besides, the circuitry area is 41 times smaller. SVR with Gaussian kernel shows a success rate of 99.18% and minimum square error of 0.0146 for testing with the planning trajectory. This system is useful for adaptive applications where the user/designer can modify/reconfigure the hardware layout during its application, thus contributing to lower power consumption, smaller hardware area, and shorter execution time. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This article investigates a dual-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted short-packet covert communication system in the presence of a warden. Specifically, one flying UAV serves as the base station to transmit covert information to a legitimate ground user, and the other flying UAV is deployed as a cooperative jammer to transmit artificial noise against detection by a warden. Considering a more practical scenario, where only imperfect location information of the warden is known at both UAVs, we jointly optimize both UAVs' transmit powers and 3-D trajectories to maximize the average covert transmission rate under the constraints of both UAVs' mobility, transmit powers and warden's detection error probability (DEP). On the one hand, the incomplete Gamma function involved in warden's DEP makes the covertness constraint intractable for further analysis. To facilitate the design, warden's DEP is lower bounded by Pinsker's inequality. On the other hand, the formulated optimization problem is intractable to solve directly owing to the multiple highly coupled variables and the uncertainty of the warden's location. The alternating optimization algorithm combined with the successive convex approximation and S-procedure techniques is leveraged to solve three optimization subproblems iteratively. Numerical results reveal that superior performance can be achieved by employing the proposed joint optimization of both UAVs' transmit powers and 3-D trajectories algorithm compared with the traditional 2-D trajectory optimization algorithm and the scheme without the assistance of the cooperative UAV. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - This paper exploits the mobility of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to improve the physical layer (PLS) security against potential eavesdropping scenarios, where the sensitive data transmitted from a ground base station (GBS) to multiple information receivers (IRs) is easily eavesdropped by multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers (Eves). Specifically, the UAV is employed as a friendly jammer to transmit artificial noise to degrade the wiretap channels. By leveraging the UAV's mobility and the possibility of establishing line-of-sight links, the UAV can move close to the Eves and opportunistically jam them. Especially, two practical factors, namely, the imperfect location information of Eves and the existence of no-fly zones are considered. Since only the partial position information of the Eves can be known, as the worst case, the minimum average secrecy rate of IRs is robustly optimized by jointly designing the trajectory and jamming power of the UAV, and the transmission power of the GBS to ensure the security of all IRs. However, the formulated problem with coupled variables is non-convex and intractable. As such, an efficient alternative iterative suboptimal algorithm is proposed to solve this problem by applying the block coordinate descent, successive convex approximation, slack variables, and mathcal S-Procedure. Numerical results reveal that the proposed robust algorithm can substantially improve the max-min average secrecy rate, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is further verified by comparing it with three benchmark schemes. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The current state of the art on jamming detection relies on link-layer metrics. A few examples are the bit-error rate (BER), the packet delivery ratio, the throughput, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As a result, these techniques can only detect jamming ex-post, i.e., once the attack has already taken down the communication link. These solutions are unfit for mobile devices, e.g., drones, which might lose the connection to the remote controller, being unable to predict the attack. Our solution is rooted in the idea that a drone unknowingly flying toward a jammed area is experiencing an increasing effect of the jamming, e.g., in terms of BER and SNR. Therefore, drones might use the abovementioned phenomenon to detect jamming before the increase of the BER and the decrease of the SNR completely disrupt the communication link. Such an approach would allow drones and their pilots to make informed decisions and maintain complete control of navigation, enhancing security and safety. This article proposes Bloodhound+, a solution for jamming detection on mobile devices in low-BER regimes. Our approach analyzes raw physical-layer information (I-Q samples) acquired from the wireless channel. We assemble this information into grayscale images and use sparse autoencoders to detect image anomalies caused by jamming attacks. To test our solution against a broad set of configurations, we acquired a large data set of indoor measurements using multiple hardware, jamming strategies, and communication parameters. Our results indicate that Bloodhound+ can detect indoor jamming up to 20 m from the jamming source at the minimum available relative jamming power, with a minimum accuracy of 99.7%. Our solution is also robust to various sampling rates adopted by the jammer and to the type of signal used for jamming. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite Signal-of-Opportunity (SOP) positioning technology has gradually matured to meet the accuracy requirements for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) positioning in daily scenarios. Advancements in miniaturization technology for positioning terminals have also made this technology’s application to UAV positioning crucial for UAV development. However, in the increasingly complex electromagnetic environment, there remains a significant risk of degradation in positioning performance for UAVs in LEO satellite SOP positioning due to unintentional or malicious jamming. Furthermore, there is a lack of in-depth research from scholars both domestically and internationally on the anti-jamming capabilities of LEO satellite SOP positioning technology. Due to significant differences in the downlink signal characteristics between LEO satellites and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals based on Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) or Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites, the anti-jamming research results of traditional satellite navigation systems cannot be directly applied. This study addresses the narrow bandwidth and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) characteristics of signals from LEO satellite constellations. We propose a Consecutive Iteration based on Signal Cancellation (SCCI) algorithm, which significantly reduces errors during the model fitting process. Additionally, an adaptive variable convergence factor was designed to simultaneously balance convergence speed and steady-state error during the iteration process. Compared to traditional algorithms, simulation and experimental results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm enhances the effectiveness of jamming threshold settings under narrow bandwidth and high-power conditions. In the context of LEO satellite jamming scenarios, it improves the frequency-domain anti-jamming performance significantly and holds high application value for drone positioning. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been emerged as cost-effective platforms to extend the coverage of mobile edge computing (MEC) system. However, the broadcast and line-of-sight (LoS) channels in UAV communications create opportunities for malicious eavesdroppers to intercept the offloaded information from ground users, posing a serious challenge to both communication and computing security. In this correspondence, we investigate the problem of secure transmission in UAV-aided MEC systems. Our goal is to maximize the average secure computing capacity by jointly designing the UAV trajectory, time allocation and offloading decision strategy. To this end, we propose a novel double-deep Q-learning (DDQN) based trajectory optimization and resource allocation scheme. Furthermore, the size of the original action space is reduced to boost the convergence of the proposed DDQN-based scheme. Additionally, we design a reward function to navigate the UAV towards its intended destination. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DDQN-based scheme outperforms the baselines in terms of average secure computing capacity. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications
AB  - In this paper, we consider a novel cellular network for aerial users, which is composed of dedicated base stations (BSs), whose antennas are directed towards aerial users, and traditional terrestrial BSs (TBSs). Besides, the dedicated BSs are deployed on roadside furniture, such as lampposts and traffic lights, to achieve multiple features while occupying less space. Therefore, the locations of dedicated BSs and TBSs are modeled by a Poisson-line-Cox-process (PLCP) and Poisson point process (PPP), respectively. For the proposed network, we first compute the aerial coverage probability and show that the deployment of dedicated BSs improves the coverage probability in both high dense areas and rural areas. We then consider a cellular-connected UAV that has a flying mission and optimize its trajectory to maximize the minimal achievable signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) (Max-Min SINR). To obtain the Max-Min SINR and minimal time trajectory that satisfies the Max-Min SINR, we proposed two algorithms that are practical in large-scale networks. Finally, our results show that the optimal density of dedicated BSs which maximizes Max-Min SINR decreases with the increase of the road densities. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Spoofing, alongside jamming of the Global Navigation Satellite System signal, remains a significant hazard during general aviation or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle operations. As aircraft utilize various support systems for navigation, such as INS, an insufficient Global Navigation Satellite System signal renders Unmanned Aerial Vehicles nearly uncontrollable, thereby posing increased danger to operations within airspace and to individuals on the ground. This paper primarily focuses on assessing the impact of the budget friendly Software-Defined Radio, HackRF One 1.0, on the safety of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles operations. Considering the widespread use of Software-Defined Radio devices today, with some being reasonably inexpensive, understanding their influence on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles safety is crucial. The generation of artificial interference capable of posing a potential threat in expanding Unmanned Aerial Vehicles airspace is deemed unacceptable. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - With the evolutional development of maritime networks, the explosive growth of maritime data has put forward elevated demands for the computing capabilities of maritime devices (MDs). Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is able to alleviate the computing pressure of MDs by forwarding the computing tasks to the edge server on the coast. However, UAV relaying introduces a significant security challenge due to the vulnerability of line-of-sight (LoS) communication channels, which can be exploited for eavesdropping on computing tasks. In this paper, an efficient secure communication scheme is proposed for UAV-relay-assisted maritime mobile edge computing (MEC) with a flying eavesdropper. The secure computing capacity of MDs is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit power, time slot allocation factor, computation optimization and UAV trajectory. Due to multi-variable coupling, the formulated optimization problem (OP) is non-convex. We first transform OP by introducing auxiliary variables. Then, the transformed OP is decomposed and solved in an iterative manner by applying block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Numerical results show that the secure computing capability of the UAV-relay-assisted maritime MEC system of proposed secure communication scheme can be effectively improved compared with benchmarks. © 1972-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Area coverage is an important problem in robotics applications, which has been widely used in search and rescue, offshore industrial inspection, and smart agriculture. This paper demonstrates a novel unified robust path planning, optimal trajectory generation, and control architecture for a quadrotor coverage mission. To achieve safe navigation in uncertain working environments containing obstacles, the proposed algorithm applies a modified probabilistic roadmap to generating a connected search graph considering the risk of collision with the obstacles. Furthermore, a recursive node and link generation scheme determines a more efficient search graph without extra complexity to reduce the computational burden during the planning procedure. An optimal three-dimensional trajectory generation is then suggested to connect the optimal discrete path generated by the planning algorithm, and the robust control policy is designed based on the cascade NLH_infty framework. The integrated framework is capable of compensating for the effects of uncertainties and disturbances while accomplishing the area coverage mission. The feasibility, robustness and performance of the proposed framework are evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations, PX4 Software-In-the-Loop test facility, and real-world experiments. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Despite the significant advancements in drone sensory device reliability, data integrity from these devices remains critical in securing successful flight plans. A notable issue is the vulnerability of GNSS to jamming attacks or signal loss from satellites, potentially leading to incomplete drone flight plans. To address this, we introduce SiaN-VO, a Siamese neural network designed for visual odometry prediction in such challenging scenarios. Our preliminary studies have shown promising results, particularly for flights under static conditions (constant speed and altitude); while these findings are encouraging, they do not fully represent the complexities of real-world flight conditions. Therefore, in this paper, we have furthered our research to enhance SiaN-VO, improving data integration from multiple sensors and enabling more accurate displacement predictions in dynamic flight conditions, thereby marking a significant step forward in drone navigation technology. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Future UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operations in urban environments demand a PNT (position, navigation, and timing) solution that is both robust and resilient. While a GNSS (global navigation satellite system) can provide an accurate position under open-sky assumptions, the complexity of urban operations leads to NLOS (non-line-of-sight) and multipath effects, which in turn impact the accuracy of the PNT data. A key research question within the research community pertains to determining the appropriate hybrid fusion architecture that can ensure the resilience and continuity of UAV operations in urban environments, minimizing significant degradations of PNT data. In this context, we present a novel federated fusion architecture that integrates data from the GNSS, the IMU (inertial measurement unit), a monocular camera, and a barometer to cope with the GNSS multipath and positioning performance degradation. Within the federated fusion architecture, local filters are implemented using EKFs (extended Kalman filters), while a master filter is used in the form of a GRU (gated recurrent unit) block. Data collection is performed by setting up a virtual environment in AirSim for the visual odometry aid and barometer data, while Spirent GSS7000 hardware is used to collect the GNSS and IMU data. The hybrid fusion architecture is compared to a classic federated architecture (formed only by EKFs) and tested under different light and weather conditions to assess its resilience, including multipath and GNSS outages. The proposed solution demonstrates improved resilience and robustness in a range of degraded conditions while maintaining a good level of positioning performance with a 95th percentile error of 0.54 m for the square scenario and 1.72 m for the survey scenario. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in Internet-of-Things (IoT) has grown, but security for UAV communications still a challenge due to the distributed nature of line-of-sight communication networks. This paper analyses the security issues for UAV-assisted MEC systems, in which UAVs are used to support base stations (BSs) in computing offloaded workloads while also operate as jammers to inhibit malicious eavesdroppers. In this paper, a minimum secure computing capacity maximization issues is addressed by jointly optimizing communication link, computation resources, and UAVs trajectories. These issues are of a non-trivial nature and present a significant challenge to be resolved due to the presence of highly coupled variables. In order to effectively overcome these issues, we introduced the concept of WEB 3.0. Firstly, we introduced blockchain method to enhance security to the UAV assisted MEC system and then to train the data locally and to solve various wireless schemes problems, respectively we proposed a FL method. To contribute to the literature, we developed an effective resource allocation strategy that maximizes computational offloading using WEB 3.0, a Blockchain-based FRL method. Finally, numerical findings indicate that the suggested techniques improve the security computation capacity efficiency of the systems when compared to the standards. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become crucial tools for post-disaster rescue and equipment inspection, offering significant social value. However, this demands exceptional navigation capabilities from UAVs in unknown and noisy environments. This paper proposes a novel robust path planning strategy to address the challenges faced by UAVs navigating in such conditions. The strategy integrates an image denoising module, ALSP-ID, which calculates similarity weights using Euclidean distance and vectorized representation. This effectively removes noise from depth maps while preserving edge information. By constructing an end-to-end network architecture, the perception and planning functions are trained simultaneously, reducing computational resource requirements. Additionally, the introduction of a channel attention mechanism allows the network to better focus on critical feature channels, enhancing the model's expressive ability and generalization performance. Experiments firmly validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving path planning robustness, path smoothness, and obstacle avoidance capabilities. Notably, it excels in handling noise and adapting to unknown environments, providing strong technical support for the autonomous navigation of UAVs in complex scenarios. © 2024 IEEE.

AU  - Zeng, Bingzhi
AU  - Gong, Xin
AB  - This paper designs a scenario for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assist in telecommunication tower inspection.There are opportunities for further exploration in several areas: 1) Comprehensive practical constraints should be considered; 2) Strong or intelligent attacks should be considered; 3) Single-UAV scenarios should not be the only scenarios considered.This paper focuses on a task where a swarm of UAVs fly within a certain space to inspect the signal strength of telecommunication towers, while also introducing intelligent interference attacks.Specifically, the UAV swarm needs to use a path planning algorithm with excellent robustness to counter this intelligent jamming attack, complete inspection from multiple telecommunication towers, and reach the destination within a specified time limit, while satisfying various practical constraints, including kinematic constraints, no-fly zone constraints, and task deadline constraints.This paper adopts the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm from Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to solve this problem.This work gradually illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of defense measures in scenarios with no jamming attacks, fixed jamming attacks, and intelligent jamming attacks. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Currently, drones pose a threat to maritime navigation of ships, and how to realize the effective defense of ships against UAV has become a problem that needs to be solved urgently. Currently, the most cost-effective means of defense is UAV jamming and deception, based on the time-delayed single-station GPS forwarding deception jamming can realize the long-distance deception of UAV, interfere with their satellite positioning, and force them to deviate from the established route. This paper addresses the problems of low correlation between the deception trajectory and the original planned route, as well as unspecified destination areas in current domestic and foreign research on static deception, one-way deception, and fluctuation curve deception. A single station UAVs synchronous deception model is designed, and a delay control algorithm for synchronous deception is proposed. Through simulation calculations, the target UAVs can be successfully lured to the designated area. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - This paper addresses the critical challenge of achieving precise localization and cooperative control in UAV formation flight under conditions of limited communication and significant electromagnetic interference. The primary objective is to develop and validate a robust computational model and algorithm that ensure accurate UAV positioning while minimizing electromagnetic emissions to enhance anti-jamming capabilities. The proposed model leverages passive bearing-only localization methods, utilizing directional information from neighboring UAVs to determine positions accurately. This approach reduces the need for active signal transmissions, thereby maintaining electromagnetic silence and mitigating the risks associated with jamming and interception. Key components of the model include azimuth angle calculations and the classification of various positioning scenarios within circular UAV formations. Tailored strategies are developed for each scenario, focusing on maintaining the geometric stability of the UAV formation and optimizing position adjustments. Simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods by analyzing positioning errors under different geometric configurations. The results demonstrate that the model significantly improves operational efficiency and positioning accuracy in constrained communication environments. By integrating these methodologies into practical UAV systems, the study aims to enhance the overall effectiveness and reliability of UAV deployments in a wide range of challenging environments, contributing to the broader field of UAV navigation and control. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - With the increasing popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), their security is becoming increasingly critical, especially given the rising incidence of unauthorized global positioning system (GPS) attacks, which are the most common in UAVs and particularly difficult to detect. In this context, it is crucial to develop and implement effective measures to protect UAVs against these attacks, which not only compromise the safety of aerial operations but also pose potential threats to privacy, national security, and the integrity of satellite navigation systems. This study compares two popular software-defined radio (SDR) platforms, BladeRF and HackRF, exploring their applicability and performance through a systematic comparison in a controlled GPS attack scenario using a real UAV. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The act of deliberately directing electromagnetic energy towards a communication and/or navigation system with the purpose to interrupt or inhibit signal transmission and reception is known as jamming. Jamming is used to send high signal to disrupt the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) communication and force the UAVs to land. This prevents the operator from receiving UAV, which results in the UAV losing control. Jamming activity may present a substantial threat to the communication security of the country especially for military. A Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) filter is the alternative option to mitigate jamming activity. The FSS filter has several benefits such as effective performance in term of having high bandwidth and high transmission, low-cost and lightweight material which is suitable to be implemented for UAVs. In this paper, we investigate the performance of proposed FSS bandpass filter using Ansys software simulation at 2.4 GHz. The Ansys Software is used to design the band pass filter in a simple square shape by varying several parameters such as element length (a), width of aperture (b) and periodic length (c). A complete design and analysis of the proposed FSS square filter is based on the reflection coefficient S<inf>11</inf> and transmission coefficient S<inf>21</inf> are presented in this paper. The transmission of the filter is 97%. In conclusion, the proposed dimension of the square unit cell that can filter out the jamming signal for small UAV size is 38 mm, aperture width is 2.9 mm and the periodic length is 60 mm. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - As drone technologies become more abundant, efficient and robust, path planning has become increasingly necessary. For ease of use, Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) applications have been developed to simplify the user experience and ensure efficient navigation. These applications enhance the drone's ability to perform various tasks, such as surveillance, delivery, and photography, with reliability and precision. This paper presents an innovative Human-Drone-Interface (HDI) designed to simplify the navigation of drones along user-defined paths. Drone flight paths can be defined by drawing routes or specifying Points of Interest (POIs) on a digital map, streamlining the user experience for users. This work addresses the hardware and software challenges of interpreting user-defined paths in real time, optimizing the drone's route, and generating precise flight commands. Algorithmic computations are delegated to the cloud to enhance battery efficiency. The system incorporates the Long Range (LoRa) protocol to communicate with the drone, which enables a more extended range of operations while providing reliable connectivity in areas with poor coverage and limited broadband access. By making drones easier to operate, the proposed solution seeks to make drones more widely accessible, thus pushing the boundaries of user-friendly drone navigation. Testing results demonstrated the HDI's robust ability to consistently instruct drones along user-defined paths. This capability makes it well-suited for real-world applications such as agriculture, where precise navigation is essential for irrigation or delivery systems, where path optimization ensures timely delivery of nackages. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The 'black flight' problem is seriously threatening the security of critical areas, and developing effective countermeasures is an urgent need in both military and civilian domains. However, the anti-jamming of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) continues to evolve, and traditional countermeasure systems face challenges such as low jamming success rates and poor flexibility, making it difficult to meet the demands of defense and confrontation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a jamming method for UAV communication and navigation signals. Based on the YunSDR-Y550 software-defined radio platform, we developed the UAV_ATK upper computer interface software to communicate in real-time with the hardware platform, adjusting power, frequency bands, and bandwidth. We generate three modes of signal disruption - broadband jamming, comb jamming, and frequency sweeping jamming - to disrupt the UAV's telemetry link. We also disrupt the UAV's navigation link by jamming GPS and BDS navigation signals. By mimicking real GPS signals and generating false navigation messages, we gradually lead the receiver tracking loop to lock onto the deceptive signal, achieving intrusive deception of the UAV. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are highly versatile systems with applications expanding in various fields, for instance, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, Disaster Response, Agriculture, and many more. Although UAVs have many important advantages over conventional manned aircraft, such as cheaper operating costs and a lower risk for human pilots, their vulnerability to Radio Frequency (RF)-jamming poses a substantial risk to navigation and communication systems by disrupting signals. UAVs depend on remote control and autonomous operations. These attacks are concerning in many application areas. Communication and navigation play crucial roles in these autonomous systems. This paper aims to explore different deep-learning algorithms for the detection of RF-jamming attacks in UAVs. A comparison analysis is conducted to evaluate five distinct architectures using conventional evaluation metrics criteria comprising accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrices, and the area under the ROC curve. These comparative analyses helped in selecting an accurate architecture for the definition, RNN architecture gave an impressive accuracy of 93% and demonstrated a superior performance than other architectures. This paper aims to strengthen RF-jamming detection systems in UAVs to enhance their safety and operational reliability in several scenarios. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Drones have found extensive use in military applications owing to their inconspicuousness and easy deployment. Major challenges in the UAV space today include: (a) Maintaining seamless connectivity with the ground station to maintain command and control (C2) link and ensure continuous streaming of high quality data and (b) avoiding enroute RF jammers that can saturate the RF receiver and inhibit communication. Additionally, GNSS jammers can render drones completely nonfunctional by not allowing the drone to communicate with GPS satellites to ascertain their location. This work addresses these two challenges by developing a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that is able to optimize the wireless connectivity while avoiding jammers along the drone route. Notably, the algorithm ensures minimal deviation from the planned path in the presence of jammers. The training process for the drone can be completely accomplished pre-flight. The drone is only required to carry a lookup table (Q-table) during flight thereby reducing the computing requirements onboard the drone. © 2024 IEEE.

AU  - Jia, Xiangdong

AU  - Sun, Yangyang
AB  - Due to the broadcast nature, wireless communications can be easily overheard by malicious eavesdroppers. In this paper, artificial noise sent by the friendly unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-jammer is used to weaken the eavesdropping channel from the secondary relay (SR) to the eavesdropper, in order to achieve the objective of optimizing the secrecy AoI (SAoI) of the system. With this consideration, this paper interests the SAoI of a relay cooperation system with the assistance of a UAV jammer and proposes two optimal policies. The Optimization problem is described as a joint optimization of the secondary system transmission power, the UAV transmission power and the UAV trajectory. This work designs the optimal framework that is solved with a tractable CVX tool and slack variables. Simulation results show that the UAV trajectory perform well in minimizing the AoI, and indicate that the information secrecy and freshness are simultaneously guaranteed. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) plays an important role in fifth and sixth (5G/6G) communication systems, garnering significant research attention. This paper investigates a dynamic UAV-enabled secure ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) system, where a UAV sends confidential data to a mobile device where another UAV cooperatively transmits jamming interference to confuse a potential eavesdropper. The transmission latency constraint, secure communication requirement and dynamic channel characteristics are considered into real-word communication environments. Then, a joint communication transmit power, jamming power, and trajectory optimization approach is proposed to maximize the system secrecy rate, simultaneously guaranteeing the URLLC requirement. To effectively address the non-convex problem, the URLLC constraint is transformed into a data rate constraint to ensure that the optimization problem is more manageable, and then present an efficient solution by employing an alternating approximation and successive convex optimization. Finally, simulation results verify that the presented joint optimization approach substantially outperforms other popular benchmarks in secrecy rate performance. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a theoretical framework for a GPS signals jamming simulator designed to evaluate the effects of jamming on a GPS receiver onboard a UAV in an aerodynamic environment. This methodological study focuses on modeling the jammer, the GPS receiver, the propagation environment, and the electronic attack scenario. While commercially available GNSS jamming simulators exist, they can be expensive due to their complexity. This proposed simulator offers an alternative approach to assess the reliability of GPS observables like pseudo ranges, carrier phases, and Doppler measurements under jamming attacks. Furthermore, the framework allows for the exploration and development of anti-jamming techniques capable of detection, mitigation, and localization of interference sources. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - 'Kometa-M' type Global Navigation Satellite System is widely used by the invading russian army in Ukraine to secure robust location measurements for its rockets, drones and other war elements. It is reported that this system is extremely difficult to jam with the existing noise generators. Features and design of this 'Kometa-M' device are not known for sure and only some assumptions can be made from the trophy exemplars and analysis of the constituent parts. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze what possible adaptive algorithms this device can deploy and to find ways of effectively jamming it with existing interference generators. It is shown that this type of GNSS is manufactured in the form of the planar adaptive antenna array that includes four standard TAOGLAS receiving elements. The dimensions of the array are measured from the war trophy and the known dimensions of the TAOGLAS elements. Analysis allows one to assume that the 'Kometa-M' device is designed to work in two modes: interference-free regime of operation and interference regime of operation. The second regime is crucial for the operation of this device because in this regime it implements an adaptive antenna algorithm to overcome the interferences. One can suppose that among adaptive algorithms, there can be implemented either side lobe canceller system in which one of the four elements is designated as the main antenna or an algorithm for the full-blooded adaptive antenna array that does not require any reference signals. The first assumption as to the adaptive algorithm is tested and the efficiency of this algorithm is proven. The second assumption is expected to be tested in the follow-up research. Obtained results can be used for working out jamming technics to countermeasure this Global Navigation Satellite System. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) serves as a critical tool for both military and civilian operations worldwide. However, its limitations in certain operational environments and vulnerability to interference or jamming have become increasingly apparent in recent years. Quantum technology has emerged as a crucial enabler of alternative solutions. In this presentation, our focus will be on the magnetic aided inertial navigation system (MAINS), which has shown promise as a navigation alternative in GNSS-denied environments. MAINS leverages anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field, often referred to as magnetic anomaly maps, to assist inertial navigation systems and correct drift. In general, optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) in combination with classical vector sensors are employed to measure the magnetic field. OPMs collect precise and accurate measurements of the magnetic field intensity, while vector sensors provide information on its direction. This directional information is crucial for successfully estimating and removing the platform's own magnetic field. Additionally, to minimize the magnetic influence of the navigation platform, these sensors should be situated as far as possible from the platform itself, such as on a stinger behind the aircraft. However, integrating these sensors into smaller platforms like drones presents significant challenges, particularly in mitigating the platform's own magnetic interference, which may overshadow magnetic anomalies. In this paper, we will discuss the challenges associated with using quantum sensors for drone navigation and explore noise compensation algorithms. Additionally, we will share the results of our measurement campaign conducted on a fixed-wing drone. Lastly, we will examine how NV magnetometers could potentially improve noise compensation algorithms by employing more accurate vector measurements. © 2024 SPIE.

AB  - This paper analyzes and compares different visual-inertial (V-INS) sensor fusion strategies, conceived to enable GNSS-resilient navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). The strategies share the same data fusion architecture, based on a loosely coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), but have variable characteristics concerning the image processing and pose estimation pipelines. Specifically, four different geolocation strategies are investigated to retrieve range information about the detected visual features in the observed scene, exploiting a flat Earth assumption, a local flat Earth assumption, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) intersection and a triangulation method, respectively. The latter approach, in particular, does not require any geometrical assumption or any a priori knowledge on the observed scene. Furthermore, an original approach to provide the EKF with a consistent estimate of the covariance associated to the visual-based pose solution is proposed. The navigation performance is evaluated by means of numerical simulations reproducing a straight trajectory with hovering and a curved trajectory, both over an almost flat and a mountain scenario. In the best case of the flat scenario, the percentage error on the position estimate, computed with respect to the UAV traveled distance, is less than 0.15%, and the error on the attitude angles estimate is less than 0.08°, while the Root Mean Square (RMS) values of the same quantities are about 0.09% and 0.04°, respectively. In the mountain scenario the performance is degraded but the maximum errors are still kept approximately within 1% and 1o, respectively. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - In blockchain-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication systems, the length of a block affects the performance of the blockchain. The transmission performance of blocks in the form of finite character segments is also affected by the block length. Therefore, it is crucial to balance the transmission performance and blockchain performance of blockchain communication systems, especially in wireless environments involving UAVs. This paper investigates a secure transmission scheme for blocks in blockchain-based UAV communication systems to prevent the information contained in blocks from being completely eavesdropped during transmission. In our scheme, using a friendly jamming UAV to emit jamming signals diminishes the quality of the eavesdropping channel, thus enhancing the communication security performance of the source UAV. Under the constraints of maneuverability and transmission power of the UAV, the joint design of UAV trajectories, transmission power, and block length are proposed to maximize the average minimum secrecy rate (AMSR). Since the optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve directly, we first decompose the optimization problem into subproblems of trajectory optimization, transmission power optimization, and block length optimization. Then, based on first-order approximation techniques, these subproblems are reformulated as convex optimization problems. Finally, we utilize an alternating iteration algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to solve these subproblems iteratively. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can achieve secure transmission for blocks while maintaining the performance of the blockchain. © © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - With the development of UAV and autonomous driving technology, the accurate acquisition of spatial location information is more and more closely related to people’s production and life. However, because the navigation signal is very weak when it reaches the ground, the signal is vulnerable to interference, and human interference has a destructive effect on navigation applications. Human interference to navigation signals can be divided into two categories: suppression interference and deception interference. This paper first briefly introduces the difference between spoofing and squishing jamming and the types of spoofing jamming, and then analyzes spoofing jamming detection technology and its research status from the perspectives of message encryption identity authentication, spatial processing, signal power detection, signal quality detection, Doppler shift consistency, positioning and navigation results and machine learning. The research direction of multi-technology comprehensive detection is prospected. © 2024 SPIE.

AB  - The article presents the first implementation of the Signal Doppler Frequency (SDF) location method on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) named Autonomous System of Location radio EmmiteRs (ASLER), employing a DJI Matrice UAV as its mobile platform for the radio sensor. The system is used for position estimation, i.e., determining the location coordinates of localized radio emitters. Such functionality is the basis of radio reconnaissance, electronic warfare, or combat systems, and many radio navigation systems. The ASLER localization procedure is based on the Doppler localization method, also known as the SDF. Its distinctive feature is the use of a single moving platform for localization. In addition, the SDF allows simultaneous localization of multiple emission sources, which is an innovative distinction compared to other solutions of this class. ASLER is the first autonomous implementation of the SDF method on a flying platform. This paper illustrates the hardware and software implementation of location sensor, and results of the first empirical studies. © The Author(s).

AB  - In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation, achieving high positioning accuracy is crucial but can be hindered by dynamic environmental uncertainties. This paper introduces DeepCovPG, a novel framework that leverages deep learning and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology to enhance positioning precision significantly. At its core, DeepCovPG incorporates a novel neural network architecture, combining Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, to refine UWB range data by noise reduction and dynamic covariance prediction. This approach integrates a dynamic covariance model within the pose graph optimization process, diverges from conventional static uncertainty approaches, enhancing adaptability to environmental shifts and measurement errors. Tested across various settings, including indoor spaces and urban landscapes, DeepCovPG demonstrated a significant 51% reduction in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and substantial Mean Absolute Error (MAE) improvements over traditional methods, proving its effectiveness in tackling signal interference and navigational challenges for reliable UAV positioning. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in military and civilian applications, such as surveillance, disaster monitoring, and rescue missions. They rely heavily on global positioning systems (GPS) for navigation. However, the accuracy and availability of GPS positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) data can suffer losses due to jamming and spoofing. To address overreliance on GPS infrastructure, this paper presents a vision-aided system to enable UAVs to estimate velocity and continue operation when GPS signal is intermittently lost. The system fuses data from onboard sensors including the inertial measurement unit (IMU), barometer, and optical flow camera using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The efficiency of this approach was validated through simulation experiments involving a UAV navigating in a circular and square motions. Statistical analysis confirmed the proposed system can provide state estimation and smooth trajectory control for UAVs during GPS signal outages. © 2024 ISIF.

AB  - This study delves into the classification of interference signals to global navigation satellite system (GNSS) stemming from mobile jammers such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) across diverse wireless communication zones, employing federated learning (FL) and transfer learning (TL). Specifically, we employ a neural network classifier, enhanced with FL to decentralize data processing and TL to hasten the training process, aiming to improve interference classification accuracy while preserving data privacy. Our evaluations span multiple data scenarios, incorporating both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-identically distributed (non-IID), to gauge the performance of our approach under different interference conditions. Our results indicate an improvement of approximately 8% in classification accuracy compared to a basic convolutional neural network (CNN) model, accompanied by expedited convergence in networks utilizing pre-trained models. Additionally, the implementation of FL not only developed privacy but also matched the robustness of centralized learning methods, particularly under IID scenarios. Moreover, the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm effectively manages regional interference variability, thereby enhancing the regional communication performance indicator, carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N<inf>0</inf>), by roughly 5 dB · Hz compared to isolated setups. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Multi-GNSS (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and BejDou) are used for PNT (Positioning, Navigation, and Timing). UMVs (Unmanned Marine Vehicles) are unmanned vessels that can navigate autonomously or remotely, carry payloads, and be disposable or repairable. UMV networks are formations of autonomous vessels without a command, capable of carrying payloads. Technologies to suppress and counter UMVs have become kye areas of research. Jamming disrupts multi-channel GNSS receivers with noise, disabling UMVs’ positioning. This article discusses suppressing UMVs navigation and countermeasures. The cybersecurity of UAVs under conditions of partial or complete interruption of several GNSS signals due to jamming and/or spoofing cannot be calculated by analytical methods, but the results of predicting the movement of the UMVs under extreme conditions can be obtained using simulation methods at the design stage of the UMVs. The main goal of the article is to increase the cybersecurity of unmanned marine vehicles in extreme conditions of partial or complete interruption of GNSS signals in general and especially because of jamming and/or spoofing. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Recent advancements in drone technology have shown that commercial off-the-shelf Micro Aerial Drones are more effective than large-sized drones for performing flight missions in narrow environments, such as swarming, indoor navigation, and inspection of hazardous locations. Due to their deployments in many civilian and military applications, safe and reliable communication of these drones throughout the mission is critical. The Crazyflie ecosystem is one of the most popular Micro Aerial Drones and has the potential to be deployed worldwide. In this paper, we empirically investigate two interference attacks against the Crazy Real Time Protocol (CRTP) implemented within the Crazyflie drones. In particular, we explore the feasibility of experimenting two attack vectors that can disrupt an ongoing flight mission: the jamming attack, and the hijacking attack. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of such attacks in both autonomous and non-autonomous flight modes on a Crazyflie 2.1 drone. Finally, we suggest potential shielding strategies that guarantee a safe and secure flight mission. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work investigating jamming and hijacking attacks against Micro Aerial Drones, both in autonomous and non-autonomous modes. © 2024 IEEE.

TI  - DroneDefGANt: A Generative AI-Based Approach for Detecting UAS Attacks and Faults
AU  - El Alami, Hassan
AU  - Rawat, Danda B.
AB  - Recently, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have become heavily reliant on communication, navigation, and other critical components such as sensors and actuators, which are essential for operations in both civilian and defense applications. However, this increasing reliance makes UAS more vulnerable to attacks and faults, posing rising threats. While there have been many advances in UAS security, a significant number of studies have proposed artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced solutions to address these challenges. Yet, no research has explored the potential of generative AI (GenAI) in this domain. GenAI stands out due to its ability to detect and prevent cyberattacks by continuously learning and adapting to new threats and vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose DroneDefGANt, a GenAI-based approach that combines the capabilities of generative adversarial networks (GAN) and transformer models. The DroneDefGANt is designed to detect both external UAS attacks like GPS spoofing and jamming, and internal attacks such as actuator faults. Through evaluations using synthetic datasets, DroneDefGANt surpassed various conventional AI models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness, particularly in the presence of Gaussian noise. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant popularity in both military and civilian sectors due to their maneuverability and versatility. However, their reliance on global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) for real-time and precise navigation makes them vulnerable to interference, particularly in hostile jamming environments. In this article, we present a novel approach to address the challenges posed by GNSS jamming in UAVs navigation. Unlike traditional multisensor fusion techniques, our method focuses on physically combining signals from multiple homogeneous sensors, extending centralized multiantenna anti-jamming techniques to cooperative distributed scenarios. This approach leverages frequency conversion and forwarding to bypass GNSS navigation band, enabling signal aggregation. Using multiple UAVs, it enhances system resilience and spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), achieving both anti-jamming and collaborative navigation objectives simultaneously. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the feasibility and potential of this technique in ensuring precise and secure UAV operations in GNSS-jamming environments. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Autonomous vehicles such as drones and self-driving cars have been used in recent years. Many autonomous vehicles use the global positioning system (GPS) to acquire location data, which requires high accuracy. On the other hand, electromagnetic (EM) environment inside the autonomous vehicle is complicated since EM noise sources and a GPS antenna are densely mounted. This environment may degrade the accuracy of positioning measurements by EM interference between EM noise and GPS signals. Previous studies have reported the interference of EM noise with global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and with the mobile communications used by drones. Evaluations and countermeasures for the EM interference problems are necessary since the accuracy degradation of positioning measurements may lead to contact accidents between aircraft. In this study, we evaluated the EM interference between EM noise and GPS signals. There are two setups for the evaluation, the actual setup using a GPS receiver module and the simulation setup. These two evaluation setups were confirmed to be quantitative and reliable by the EM interference evaluation using random noise. Finally, we evaluated the impact of EM interference by EM noise from a commercial drone, one of the autonomous vehicles, on the GPS receiving sensitivity. The sensitivity degraded by about 10 dB in the actual evaluation and by about 11 dB in the simulation evaluation. This result shows that the EM noise from autonomous vehicles has a huge impact on the sensitivity of GPS. © © 2024 IEICE.

AB  - Wireless relays can effectively extend the transmission range of information. However, if relay technology is utilized unlawfully, it can amplify potential harm. Effectively surveilling illegitimate relay links poses a challenging problem. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can proactively surveil wireless relay systems due to their flexible mobility. This work focuses on maximizing the eavesdropping rate (ER) of UAVs by jointly optimizing the trajectory and jamming power. To address this challenge, we propose a new iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation technologies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the ER through trajectory and jamming power optimization. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - With more and more distributed deployment of Internet of Things (IoTs) in 5/6G networks, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted much interest for mobile edge computing service outside the coverage of terrestrial cellular systems. However, due to the interference and coverage hole issues of UAV-assisted aerial 3D communications, how to design a suitable UAV trajectory is crucial for the performance of future 6G-UAV. In order to achieve a balance between the communication quality and mission accomplishment, we define an environmental model with random interference and formulate a trajectory optimization problem to improve the communication coverage performance in high mobility conditions. By setting an interference point in the highly dynamic networks, we propose a novel trajectory optimization algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to minimize the overall task execution delay and expected outage duration. The received data information of UAVs is used for double deep q-network (DDQN) training while the prioritized empirical replay architecture in the prioritized replay deep q network (DQN) is utilized to select the best UAV action, avoid the UAV flying into the random interference points, and reduce the random interference. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - With the wide application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), security problems of UAV systems are gradually exposed, which bring great risks to UAV application. This article surveys the security of UAV systems, including attacks and countermeasures. First, the UAV system architecture is analyzed to identify security vulnerabilities. A UAV system contains the hardware platform, software platform, radio communication link, and application software. The navigation, guidance, and control systems are three core components in software platform. Then, security threats and attacks are analyzed and categorized from the view of cyberspace security, including spoofing attacks, reply attacks, jamming attacks, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, eavesdropping attacks, side-channel attacks, manipulation attacks, and system intrusion attacks. Countermeasures are categorized based on the UAV system architecture and what attacks each countermeasure type can defend are also summarized. Compared to existing survey on security of a UAV system, more attack types and corresponding countermeasures are concluded. Finally, open issues and corresponding countermeasures on the security of UAV systems are discussed to guide the future research trend, including existing countermeasure weaknesses and challenges, and new issues and challenges. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - —Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized various industries by providing efficient and automated flight capabilities. However, reliance on GPS and traditional navigation systems poses challenges in scenarios where signal interference or failures occur. In this research, we present a novel computer-vision-based method to enhance UAV navigation, enabling accurate height and location estimation. Our approach utilizes a sophisticated network that leverages a pair of images to estimate UAV height. The pyramid stereo-matching network is employed to extract robust image features and generate a disparity map. Subsequently, a custom network processes and convolves these data, employing diverse computer vision techniques to achieve precise height estimation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we collected a comprehensive dataset by conducting flights with a Phantom 4 Pro drone over the NUST Main campus, H-12 Islamabad. The dataset encompasses images captured at 10 different heights, spanning from 100 to 280 m, with flights evenly spaced 20 m apart. In rigorous evaluations, our approach demonstrates promising results compared to existing methods. By liberating UAVs from reliance on GPS, this vision-based 3-D localization technique holds immense potential to ensure successful flights even in challenging environments. © 2024 The Authors.

By communicating the position back to the UAV, it can be used for navigation also in conditions when GNSS or other positioning systems are unavailable. In this paper we report field tests with fixed-wing UAV flights under actual GNSS jamming, where an inertial navigation system (INS) aided by both GNSS and PARS is tested. The experimental results show that uninterrupted stable flight is possible by switching between GNSS and PARS aiding. The results also show that reliable integrity monitoring of the GNSS and PARS are essential for resilient navigation when switching between GNSS and PARS, especially in conditions when the UAV fly outside the PARS frustum while GNSS is jammed. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - We demonstrate that the Bluetooth 5.1 Angle-of-Arrival feature can be used as a navigation system for automatic recovery of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), guiding the UAV into an arrest system such as a suspended net, independently from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). The effect of multipath signal interference on the elevation angle estimate is handled by a constant offset calibration. In field experiments, we demonstrate approach path following using a Skywalker X8 fixed-wing UAV and a Bluetooth antenna array. For 39 approach repetitions the resulting impact positions 40m in front of the array had standard deviations of 0.41m horizontally and 0.32m vertically according to precise RTK GNSS positioning used for comparison. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Systems have become ubiquitous and are now widely used in commercial, consumer, and military applications. Their widespread use is due to a combination of their low cost, high capability, and ability to perform tasks and go places that are not easy or safe for humans. Most UAS platforms are dependent on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), to provide positioning information for navigation and flight control. Without reliable GPS signals, the flight path cannot be trusted, and flight safety cannot be assured. However, GPS is vulnerable to several types of malicious attacks, including jamming, spoofing, or physical attacks on the GPS constellation itself. Additionally, there are environments in which GPS reception is not always possible, a key example being urban canyon areas where line-of-site to the GPS satellite constellation may be blocked or obscured by large obstacles such as buildings. Numerous methods have been proposed for position estimation in GPS denied environments. However, these methods have significant limitations and typically exhibit poor performance in certain environments and scenarios. This paper analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of existing alternate positioning methods and describes a framework where multiple positioning solutions are jointly employed to construct an optimal position estimate. The proposed framework aims to reduce computation complexity of and yield good positioning performance across a wide variety of environments. © 2024 IEEE.

T2  - IEEE Internet of Things Journal
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) show significant potential in enhancing communication services within the mobile edge computing (MEC) system by taking their advantages on the flexible mobility and reliable line-of-sight links. However, in the scenarios with multiple UAV-MECs (UMs) operating concurrently, potential conflicts in their trajectories need to be mitigated. Thus, the 3-D trajectory needs to be properly designed in a highly reliable manner. Besides, such an infrastructure-free communication paradigm also exposes a potential risk of misuse by malicious parties, which allows them to eavesdrop on private communications, posing a threat to the security and privacy. Therefore, we consider a multi-UAV-assisted MEC communication system, where a UAV maliciously eavesdrops on the data transmission from the user devices (UDs) while a jammer is deployed on the ground to interfere with the eavesdropping channel. In specific, our objective is to minimize the energy consumption and latency while incorporating fairness metrics by optimizing the 3-D trajectories of UMs, transmission power of UDs, and the offloading strategies under the constraints of ensuring communication security and load fairness. Given the complexity of this mixed-integer nonconvex programming problem, we decompose the formulated problem into three subproblems. Specifically, at each time slot, we optimize the transmit power and offloading strategies using theoretical derivation and mathematical analysis, respectively. Additionally, a multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm is employed to optimize the trajectories of UMs. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed joint optimization algorithm successfully minimizes the system energy consumption and delay as compared to benchmarking schemes. © 2014 IEEE.

TI  - Drone e-ID Vulnerability to GNSS Interference
AU  - Steiner, Jakub

AB  - Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are a key source of position, navigation, and timing for Unmanned Aircraft Systems. This holds true for the new e-ID technology as well, which is compulsory for drones operating in the SPECIFIC category since 2024. Both portable and embedded e-ID devices are a new addition to the market as a reaction to the new legislation. However, these electronic visibility enablers may be susceptible to GNSS interference, possibly leading to denial of service or false position and time information being reported. To assess the vulnerability of these newly introduced e-ID devices, two of them were subjected to a series of GNSS interference attacks. The testing included jamming-only attacks, spoofing-only attacks and attacks combining jamming with subsequent spoofing. The results show the impact of all these attacks on the position and time information, the number of satellites in view and other parameters. Additionally, the results highlight the differences between a GNSS-only e-ID device and an e-ID device with both GNSS and inertia sensors. Finally, the potential of using accuracy indicators in e-ID messages for GNSS interference detection is discussed. © 2024 Czech Technical University in Prague.

AB  - Target tracking in stand-forward swarm jamming for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a promising topic but the relevant research is tepid. This article aims at exploring this problem for multistatic radar-enabled UAVs (RUAVs) via a multiagent cooperative sensing and control scheme, in which all RUAVs constitute a multistatic radar system with variable and movable transmitting and receiving platforms, and each RUAV as an autonomous agent makes decision with other agents for transmit-receive task assignment and path planning to seek the optimal overall target tracking performance. The optimization problem of RUAVs is formulated as minimizing the Bayesian Cramr-Rao lower bound with some practical constraints. To solve this problem, an alternating iterative optimization scheme is presented, in which the coalition formation method is applied for transmit-receive task assignment and the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is devised for path planning. The alternating coalition formation and PSO (ACFPSO) algorithm is, therefore, proposed for RUAVs for target tracking in stand-forward jamming. Numerical simulations in the typical scenario are conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the ACFPSO algorithm from aspects of tracking accuracy and jamming elimination. © 1965-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networking and collaboration have significant prospects in both civilian and military applications, due to its remarkable properties in cooperative efficiency, reduced risks, and operational cost. Traditional algorithms have challenging issues of high computational complexity and low efficiency in UAV swarm networking and collaboration, while computational intelligence (CI) has attracted increasing attention since it has advantages in solving complex optimization problems. The networking of UAV swarms serves as an essential foundation for collaboration, and intelligent collaboration is a crucial means of enhancing the performance of UAV swarm systems. To date, extensive CI-based algorithms have been proposed to improve the networking and collaboration capabilities of UAV swarms, and several relevant surveys have also been presented. However, existing surveys either review networking or collaboration. To the best of our knowledge, there is no survey that simultaneously concentrates on CI-based UAV swarm networking and collaboration. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of CI-based networking and collaboration algorithms from six typical aspects including channel access, network routing, cooperative task assignment, cooperative path planning, cooperative search, and cooperative jamming. More importantly, to help researchers choose appropriate algorithms to satisfy the requirements of different missions, we classify CI-based algorithms into four categories, namely heuristic behavior search-based algorithms, policy design-based algorithms, policy learning-based algorithms, and hybrid algorithms. Finally, we discuss open issues and future directions that may influence future research on UAV swarm intelligence networking and collaboration. This review may provide new insights and valuable references for researchers in this field. © 2024 IEEE.

Finally, the paper also proposes pathways to solving the foreseeable problems with three concepts that will enable higher navigation accuracy in urban environments: a low-power terrestrial navigation aid based on multifunction communication systems, a GNSS augmentation service with reduced time-to-alert, and a landing system for AAM aircraft drones in urban environments. © 2024, Institute of Navigation

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is of crucial importance in realizing heterogeneous practical wireless application scenarios. However, it is susceptible to the severe spectrum scarcity and interference issues since it operates in the unlicensed frequency band. To tackle those issues, a dynamic spectrum sharing UAV network adopting an anti-jamming technique is considered. Two intelligent spectrum allocation and trajectory optimization schemes are designed, capitalizing on the proposed external interaction and internal inference based frameworks. For the first scheme, a novel external interaction based hybrid online-offline multi-agent actor-critic and deep deterministic policy gradient (MA2C-DDPG) framework is proposed taking into account the hybrid characteristics of discrete spectrum allocation and continuous UAV trajectory. As for the second scheme, another novel framework, the deep active inference (DAI) based on internal inference is proposed, which minimizes the internal variational free energy. Moreover, a belief learning based method is exploited to enhance the agents' perception and improve the action selection in the dynamic spectrum sharing environment. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the high efficiency of our proposed schemes. It is shown that our proposed schemes significantly improve the secondary network sum transmission rate compared to various benchmark schemes. Moreover, the proposed MA2C-DDPG and DAI frameworks demonstrate the advantages in improving the training stability and convergence speed. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles rely heavily on global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) for positioning and navigation when performing tasks. At the same time, low-cost GNSS jammers can pose a severe threat to the use of GNSSs. Interference affects the work of GNSS receivers and even causes GNSS positioning to fail, thereby increasing the possibility of drone mission failure. Aiming at the current common chirp interference, this article proposes an interference mitigation method based on the Zak transform to mitigate the impact of interference on GNSS receivers. The proposed method takes advantage of the sparsity of the interfering signal at the Doppler shift axis of the delay-Doppler domain to obtain an estimation of the interference signal, which is then subtracted from the received GNSS signal to remove the interference. Simulation results show that the proposed method is more effective in mitigating interference than other methods reported in the literature. © 1965-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can provide wireless access to terrestrial users, regardless of geographical constraints, and will be an important part of future communication systems. In this article, a multi-user downlink dual-UAVs enabled covert communication system was investigated, in which a UAV transmits critical information to ground users in the presence of multiple wardens as well as a friendly jammer UAV transmits artificial jamming signals to fight with the wardens. The scenario of wardens being outfitted with a single antenna is considered, and the detection error probability (DEP) of wardens with finite observations is researched. Then, considering the uncertainty of wardens' location, a robust optimization problem with worst-case covertness constraint is formulated to maximize the average covert rate by jointly optimizing power allocation and trajectory. To cope with the optimization problem, an algorithm based on successive convex approximation methods is proposed. Thereafter, the results are extended to the case where all the wardens are equipped with multiple antennas. After analyzing the DEP in this scenario, a tractable lower bound of the DEP is obtained by utilizing Pinsker's inequality. Subsequently, the nonconvex optimization problem was established and efficiently coped by utilizing a similar algorithm as in the single-antenna scenario. Numerical results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. © 1965-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Due to long-distance propagation, the received Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal power is low, making it highly susceptible to signal interference. In safety-critical applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), GNSS signal interference can lead to significant position, navigation and timing (PNT) service deterioration or interruption. Therefore, this work focuses on investigating the effects of Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming on a DJI Mini 2 UAV and a Garmin GPSMAP 60CSx handheld GPS receiver based on various interference signal power levels and rotation angles. The field evaluation is conducted in an open area and GPS interference signals are generated using a signal generator. The signal is emitted to the target UAV using a directional antenna, and the effect of the signal is analysed and evaluated. Then, using the same setup, the measurement is repeated by varying the rotation angles of the UAV to 0, 45 and 90°. The findings indicate that when a jammer's signal reaches approximately -110 dBm in an outdoor setting, it significantly affects GPS accuracy. The impact of GPS jamming on rotation angles is influenced by altering the UAV's position (lateral and upright) as a result of changes in antenna orientation (facing upwards or towards the interference signal). © (2023), (Science and Technology Research Institute for Defence).

AB  - Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have diverse applications and rely on GPS technology for providing information on aircraft location and position. However, a number of factors, including air conditions, satellite configuration, and interference from other sources, can impact GPS signals. GPS is also vulnerable to cyber security attacks and threats, including jamming, spoofing, and false data injection. The threats to GPS are depend on various factors and the integrity of timestamps could be compromised by cyber-attacks. This paper provides a conceptual software framework that integrates machine learning workflow, zero-trust and reinforcement learning to mitigate interference-free environment for UAS navigation.

T2  - Infrared Physics and Technology
AB  - Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have disadvantages such as signal interference, loss, and spoofing. This has led to the development of new methods to complement or replace satellite navigation. Absolute visual localization is one of the main methods of vision-based localization. The goal is to localize the current view of the UAV in a reference satellite map or in a georeferenced image of a previous flight. During nighttime, due to poor lighting conditions, infrared images are used as a substitute for visible light images. However, the significant differences between infrared and visible light images pose challenges in matching them. Therefore, this paper proposes a Semantic Segmentation-based Template Matching (SSTM) method for heterogeneous images. The method proposed in this paper breaks the general idea of using a single feature extraction algorithm for heterogeneous image matching. In this paper, the matching of UAV infrared images with visible light satellite remote sensing images is realized by unifying two different image feature extraction modules of the feature description language and the matching scheme of this feature description language. The advantages of this method are demonstrated through comparisons with other advanced techniques. With the development of semantic segmentation techniques, it is believed that this modular “translation” method can achieve matching between arbitrary sensors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper proposes an integrated sensing, navigation, and communication (ISNC) framework for safeguarding unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless networks against a mobile eavesdropping UAV (E-UAV). To cope with the mobility of the E-UAV, the proposed framework advocates the dual use of artificial noise transmitted by the information UAV (I-UAV) for simultaneous jamming and sensing to facilitate navigation and secure communication. In particular, the I-UAV communicates with legitimate downlink ground users, while avoiding potential information leakage by emitting jamming signals, and estimates the state of the E-UAV with an extended Kalman filter based on the backscattered jamming signals. Exploiting the estimated state of the E-UAV in the previous time slot, the I-UAV determines its flight planning strategy, predicts the wiretap channel, and designs its communication resource allocation policy for the next time slot. To circumvent the severe coupling between these three tasks, a divide-and-conquer approach is adopted. The online navigation design has the objective to minimize the distance between the I-UAV and a pre-defined destination point considering kinematic and geometric constraints. Subsequently, given the predicted wiretap channel, the robust resource allocation design is formulated as an optimization problem to achieve the optimal trade-off between sensing and communication in the next time slot, while taking into account the wiretap channel prediction error and the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of secure communication. To account for the E-UAV state sensing uncertainty and the resulting wiretap channel prediction error, we employ a fully-connected neural network to model the complicated mapping between the state estimation error variance and an upper bound on the channel prediction error, which facilitates the development of a low-complexity suboptimal user scheduling and precoder design algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed design compared with baseline schemes and validate the benefits of integrating sensing and navigation into secure UAV communication systems. We reveal that the dual use of artificial noise can improve both sensing and jamming and that navigation is more important for improving the trade-off between sensing and communications than communication resource allocation. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

T2  - Proceedings of the International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of The Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+
AB  - This paper extends previous research on locating Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) sources using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) by enhancing the method's accuracy and reliability. Building on earlier work, we introduce improvements in both hardware and algorithmic processing to ensure the system remains cost-effective, easily deployable, and operable by non-experts. A heading-capable GNSS receiver processes the signal from one of the two GNSS antennas through its primary port and a combined signal from a directional antenna and the second GNSS antenna through its secondary port. To prevent a loss of the GNSS heading due to strong RFI, we integrated a Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor to provide continuous heading information. We conducted flight tests to assess the system's performance, using a 5G antenna as the interference source. The results demonstrate the IMU's capability to bridge periods of GNSS heading loss, maintaining a deviation of 0.3 degrees. Additionally, we evaluated two methods for determining the bearing to the RFI source: one based on the C/N<inf>0</inf> difference between the main and auxiliary GNSS antenna, and another relying only on the auxiliary antenna's C/N<inf>0</inf> values. The latter method proved more accurate, with a bearing estimate off by only 2.3 degrees from the true bearing of the UAV to the 5G antenna. Using two measurements, each consisting of a 360° rotation from different locations, the estimated RFI source location was determined. However, due to similar angles of both measurements towards the RFI source, it resulted in an error margin of 18.4 meters. The study concludes with recommendations for further refining the system, such as using a GNSS receiver with independent Automatic Gain Control (AGC) for each antenna input and conducting more extensive field tests with real jammers to evaluate the method's efficacy at varying distances. Future work will also explore manual IMU calibration techniques to enhance heading accuracy in the absence of an initial GNSS heading calibration. © 2024 The Institute of Navigation.

AB  - UAVs have garnered considerable attention due to their stealth, survivability, and the elimination of human casualties. Beyond traditional reconnaissance and attack, they have expanded into early warning, command, and electronic warfare. Particularly, small UAVs, equipped with lightweight precision instruments, transitions from standalone operations to sophisticated manned-unmanned teaming and swarm network configurations, further broadening their application horizons. However, the escalating costs associated with these advancements underscore the importance of efficient and reliable recovery methods. Recognizing the challenges posed by reduced navigation accuracy during UAVs' recovery, especially within complex environments for swarms, we introduce an innovative radio positioning method, which harnesses signal transmissions among nodes to achieve relative positioning, thereby facilitating safe recovery. Addressing conventional positioning techniques often struggle to meet requirements at low ranging accuracies, we delved into the realm of cooperative positioning and proposed a novel TDOA-Chan method. Through theoretical derivation and simulations, we demonstrate that cooperative positioning among nodes can markedly enhance positioning accuracy, even under conditions of limited TDOA ranging precision. Our work not only shows the potential of cooperative positioning, but also paves the way for future endeavors aimed at optimizing UAV control. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - A robust and precise navigation algorithm is imperative for the autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). While most navigation algorithms rely on the global positioning system (GPS) and inertial navigation system (INS), vulnerabilities such as jamming and spoofing necessitate alternative solutions for GPS-denied environments. In robotics, visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS), such as visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) or visual odometry (VO), have been widely studied recently. However, the application of VINS has primarily been explored in ground vehicles and small drones. High-altitude UAVs present unique challenges, including feature tracking difficulties and limitations in low-cost inertial measurement units (IMUs). This paper introduces a factor graph optimization (FGO)-based VINS algorithm designed for precise navigation in high-altitude aerial imagery environments. The algorithm adopts a cascade structure, strategically leveraging the existing INS/GPS navigation solution. Contributions include proposing a relative pose factor instead of IMU preintegration, and introducing a novel constraining factor graph nodes method based on GPS availability to enhance performance by categorizing and fixing accurate nodes during optimization, mitigating navigation errors in GPS outage scenarios. The proposed algorithm excels in robustness during GPS outage scenarios, and simplicity in utilizing existing INS/GPS solutions with minimal modification. © 2024 Institute of Navigation.

AB  - The use of unmanned remotely operated drones has become an effective tool for environmental research, military applications, and search and rescue operations. The Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) looks to extend these capabilities to operate in maritime conditions by providing a modular platform that can navigate autonomously. This allows for data collection in environments that are either too hazardous or impractical for manned vessels. Due to the variability of coastal environments as well as the possibility of intentional jamming, the USV is equipped with a marine radar system to utilize Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) technology. Radar-based SLAM provides an alternative to current mapping technologies like LiDAR and stereo vision, where inclement weather or compromised visibility significantly reduces their effectiveness. This system offers a robust solution that can navigate independently with precision in coastal environments. © © held by the author.

AB  - localization and communications are two fundamental requirements for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) clusters. However, in certain severe environments, the satellite positioning and navigation service is unavailable. Moreover, the information exchange among UAV nodes also faces the risk of eavesdropping and jamming. How to realize relative positioning as well as low probability of interception (LPI) and reliable communications is an urgent issue. Inspired by the above considerations, this paper proposes an integrated communications and positioning protocol with LPI and anti-jamming waveform. We design a flexible frame structure that exploits pilots and the following data symbols for distance measurement and degree of arrival estimation. The data symbols are specially processed via the weighted fractional Fourier 4 transform (WFRFT). Compared to the traditional spread spectrum frequency communication and positioning integration technologies, the WFRFT-based LPI method not only realizes high-precision positioning but also has better security performance. In this way, secure transmission in complex electromagnetic conditions can be achieved and physical layer security can be further improved. Simulation and analysis results show that the low interception communication and positioning integration technology based on an array antenna provides a more secure and accurate solution for wireless communication and positioning, showing considerable potential for development. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The expanding use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in vital areas like traffic management, surveillance, and environmental monitoring highlights the need for robust communication and navigation systems. Particularly vulnerable are Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), which face a spectrum of interference and jamming threats that can significantly undermine their performance. While traditional deep learning approaches are adept at mitigating these issues, they often fall short for UAV applications due to significant computational demands and the complexities of managing large, centralized datasets. In response, this paper introduces Federated Reservoir Computing (FedRC) as a potent and efficient solution tailored to enhance interference classification in GNSS systems used by UAVs. Our experimental results demonstrate that FedRC not only achieves faster convergence but also sustains lower loss levels than traditional models, highlighting its exceptional adaptability and operational efficiency. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - With the widespread application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in areas such as cellular networks and disaster response, preventing their communication links from being externally detected and eavesdropped has become a challenge. In the context of covert secure transmission in a collaborative scenario of UAV nodes under non-Gaussian noise interference, we introduces a secure and efficient transmission design scheme based on Multi-Agent (MA) deep reinforcement learning. Initially, an optimization problem aiming to maximize secure covert transmission throughput is formulated and transformed into a MA Markov Decision Process (MDP). Subsequently, an Attention Mechanism (AM) combined with MA Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MATD3) is employed to solve the problem using a MA deep reinforcement learning algorithm, optimizing the trajectories and power of UAV transmitters and jammers. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits smoother convergence and achieves superior secure transmission performance in a multi-UAV network scenario assisted by non-Gaussian noise at UAV nodes. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) utilise the Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation. Nevertheless, it is susceptible to obstruction and jamming threats. This paper investigates LoRa (Long Range) technology to create a redundant UAV localisation system, addressing the challenges of GPS dependency and vulnerability to signal disruptions. The system operates at 915 MHz, utilising Arduino and LoRa transceivers for Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)-based trilateration. LoRa provides an operational radius of up to 20 km in line of sight, providing GPS-free UAV navigation. Real-time monitoring and analyses have been performed via MATLAB and the IoT-based cloud platform, ThingSpeak. The experiment demonstrated that UAV localisation can be performed in line-of-sight (LoS) and Non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments. The findings suggest that the path loss exponents of 3.2 and 3.4 were suitable for the area in which the experiment was conducted. LoRa's exceptional capabilities such as its low power, long range and geolocation, help address the urgent demand for reliability in military, civilian surveillance and disaster response contexts. Future research is necessary to develop a complete UAV localisation system that utilises trilateration and LoRa technology. Further work can include testing with different antennas, testing in different environments and producing a real-time monitoring application. © The Institution of Engineering & Technology 2024.

AB  - With the advantages of high mobility and flexible deployment, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) combines with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising technology. When dynamic Terminal Users (TUs) offload tasks to UAVs, eavesdroppers may eavesdrop on the channel information. The offloading decisions, trajectory plannings of UAVs and resource allocation with the objective of high-capacity secure communication is a challenging problem. In this paper, we design a multi-UAVs MEC system, where the original region is divided into several sub-regions and TUs offload tasks to UAVs which provide computing services for these TUs. Meanwhile, A joint optimization problem of offloading decision, resource allocation and trajectory planning is formulated, where TUs move with the Gauss-Markov random model. In addition, the Base Station (BS) emits jamming signals to evade the eavesdropping of offloading information from eavesdroppers. The goal of the optimization problem is to maximize the TUs' minimum secure calculation capacity, and a Joint Dynamic Programming and Bidding (JDPB) algorithm is proposed to solve it. The Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) and Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) algorithms are used to handle the resource allocation and trajectory planning problems, and the bidding method is used to address the task offloading decision problem. Simulation results show that JDPB has better performance and better robustness under different parameter settings than other schemes. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents the design of multiband waveforms for software-defined radio (SDR) based jamming applications. The proposed waveforms comprise frequency-swept continuous wave signals with band-switch properties. With appropriate in-band sweep rate and inter-band hop delay, the waveforms show a strong potential for use in agile jammers. As a use case, a dual (L1 and L2) and tri-band (L1, L2, and L5) waveform is designed for navigation receiver jamming working on L1 (1575.42 MHz) and L2 (1227.6 MHz) bands. The proposed waveforms are generated using GNU radio and a commercially available SDR. The jamming experiment shows the successful jamming of two different types of receivers: one with a ublox receiver working on both L1 and L2 bands and another on a DJI FPV drone working on L1 and L2 bands. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - This paper addresses the path planning problem for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), where a UAV serves as a messenger to periodically traverse over road-constrained ground vehicles (GVs) to relay information. The GVs may not move on the road network with the velocities agreed with the UAV due to their movement uncertainties. The UAV path planning problem can be formulated as the Dynamic Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Uncertain Neighborhood (DDTSPUN). To address the uncertainty in GVs motion, we define robust neighborhoods and corridors and prove that the UAV visiting these areas can revisit GVs reliably, thus transforming DDTSPUN into a Revisit-time-constrained Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhood (RDTSPN). To address the RDTSPN, we propose an online heuristic path planning algorithm. This algorithm incorporates a gradient-based method for visiting robust neighborhoods and a sampling-based search strategy along robust corridors to obtain the Dubins paths of UAV that achieve the robust visit for each GV. Finally, computational experiments demonstrate its advantage over other benchmark algorithms in obtaining the shortest path satisfying UAV curvature constraints, and ensuring robust access to all GVs. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - With the increasing prevalence of small drones, the associated security risks are becoming increasingly prominent. Mainstream countermeasures include radio suppression jamming, navigation deception, fire damage, and directed energy attacks. Among these, navigation deception technology offers strong versatility, flexibility, and low radiation power by causing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to deviate from preset flight routes through false satellite signals. To enhance the accuracy of UAV trajectory spoofing, this study proposes a method to identify the guidance model of rotary-wing UAVs by analyzing flight control mechanisms and constructing navigation and guidance models under spoofing conditions. A guidance model identification algorithm was designed for two common guidance modes in rotary-wing UAVs: classical and L1 guidance. The method was applied to a PX4-based simulation platform, where the guidance model of a quadrotor UAV was successfully recognized, effectively verifying the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. © 2024 IEEE.

T2  - Journal of Aerospace Information Systems
AB  - Navigation is a critical task for the operations of both manned and unmanned aircraft systems. Current positioning systems rely primarily on satellite systems such as the Global Positioning System (GPS) or alternative sensor fusion algorithms, which typically require vision sensing and processing. Due to the possibility of temporary GPS outages and/or GPS jamming, it is critical for aircraft sensing systems to predict the position as well as the ground velocity of the aircraft in the absence of GPS signals. This work proposes two state estimation algorithms for predicting the position and ground velocity of aircraft. These methods do not require vision sensors or aircraft dynamic model information, thus providing a portable approach applicable to any aircraft. The proposed methods consider infrequent GPS position updates. Although not completely GPS free, these algorithms do not require GPS velocity measurements and can predict the aircraft position in between the position updates. The proposed methods use the information filter and unscented information filter; they are first validated using unmanned aircraft flight data and later applied to flight data from a high-speed manned military trainer jet. The results indicate the effectiveness of this approach for model-free position and ground velocity estimation. © 2023 by Matthew B. Rhudy, Mario L. Fravolini, and Marcello R. Napolitan.o.

AB  - The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to disruption sources, such as signal jamming. This, in turn, can cause severe degradation or discontinuities of the GNSS-based position, navigation, and timing services. The availability of multi-frequency signals from multi-constellation GNSS systems, such as Galileo and GLONASS, along with the modernization of GPS with multi-frequency signals, has the potential to increase the immunity of GNSS-based navigation systems to signal jamming. Despite various studies completed on the utilization of multi-frequency and multi-constellation global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals to resist receiver jamming, there is still an urge to further investigate this concern under different circumstances. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of the advantages of the employment of multi-frequency multi-constellation GNSS signals for better GNSS receivers’ performance during signal jamming situations for high-dynamic platforms such as aircraft/drones. Additionally, the study examines the effects of both simulated and real jamming signals on all possible combinations of the GPS, Galileo, and GLONASS signal frequencies and constellations. Two airplane trajectory routes were built, and their corresponding RF signals were generated using the Spirent and Orolia GNSS signal simulators. The results indicated that the GPS multi-frequency-based solution maintains reliable positioning performance to some extent under low jamming scenarios. However, the combination of GPS, Galileo, and GLONASS signals proved its ability to provide a continuous and accurate positioning solution during both low and high jamming scenarios. © 2023 by the authors.

T2  - Eurasip Journal on Advances in Signal Processing
AB  - With the inherent advantages of exceptional maneuverability, flexible deployment options and cost-effectiveness, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present themselves as a viable solution for providing aerial communication services to Internet of Things devices in high-traffic or remote areas. Nevertheless, the openness of the air–ground channel poses significant security challenges to UAV-based wireless systems. In this paper, a UAV-assisted secure communication system model is established based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) from the perspective of physical layer security, aiming to conceal the transmission behavior between UAVs and legitimate users (LUs). Specifically, a mobile UAV assumes the role of an aerial base station, leveraging NOMA technique to transmit data to LUs while evading detection from mobile eavesdropper situated on the ground. To fortify the security performance of the system, a hovering UAV acts as a friendly jammer and transmits interference signals to mobile eavesdropper (referred to as Eve). The objective of this scheme is to maximize the minimum average secure rate of all LUs by meticulously optimizing the trajectory and power allocation of the mobile UAV, subject to secrecy performance constraints. The highly interdependent and non-convex nature of this optimization problem renders direct solutions infeasible. Hence, this paper designs an efficient iterative algorithm that decouples the original problem into two subproblems, enabling an alternating optimization process for the trajectory and power allocation of the mobile UAV until the convergence of the objective function is achieved. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively improves the minimum average secure rate of all LUs compared with the benchmark scheme. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication is a significant technology in 6G communication. In order to cope with the dynamic trajectory optimization problem of the air-ground network, the interaction between entities is modeled as a Markov game firstly. Then, the model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is adopted to optimize individual decision-making. This enables agents to learn the mobile patterns of others, so as to optimize their own mobile strategy. However, there are some common issues when executing the benchmark MARL algorithms, such as biased estimation and local optimum. To solve these problems, an enhanced multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is proposed with policy clipping and average evaluation to guarantee the fast convergence and accurate estimation. Simulations demonstrate that this method produces superior convergence than the benchmark algorithms. It allows the UAV base station, ground users and the aerial jammer to adopt the optimal mobile strategies to achieve their respective maximum cumulative rewards. In addition, the stable strategies of agents constitute the approximate Nash equilibrium for the UAV-assisted communication Markov Game. © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - In current trends, Unmanned Aerial vehicles adopt a wide range of services for several applications, such as logistics, rescue operations, and real-time monitoring. UAVs’ are proven be provide a safe and cost-effective solution. Efficient Path planning is crucial to the navigation of UAVs in different environments. However, finding an optimal path is challenging as it is about more than just finding the shortest path but also considering many factors, such as path generation time and path quality. The present work aims to design and develop an efficient algorithm for providing an obstacle-free path approach between two points. The present work proposed a novel path planning scheme (Rapid A*) using a bounded line-of-sight approach to provide a guaranteed solution and achieve motivating results concerning path length and path generation time. We also provide a detailed comparative analysis of the proposed RA* approach with trademark and the latest approaches A*, Beam Search, IDA*, DWA*, and Theta* algorithm. In terms of path generation time and while considering the realistic path, the proposed approach outperforms other approaches and achieves approx 18% less path generation time as compared to A*, Beam Search and Theta* algorithm and 4% less path length as compared to A*, Beam Search, IDA* and DWA* algorithm. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - This article presents a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to the trajectory planning and jamming rejection of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Jamming can prevent timely delivery of sensing data and reception of operation instructions. With the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), we propose to augment the radio environment, suppress jamming signals, and enhance the desired signals. The UAV is designed to learn its trajectory and the RIS configuration based solely on changes in its received data rate, using the latest deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed DDPG (TD3) models. Simulations show that the proposed DRL algorithms give the UAV with strong resistance against jamming and that the TD3 algorithm exhibits faster and smoother convergence than the DDPG algorithm, and suits better for larger RISs. This DRL-based approach eliminates the need for knowledge of the channels involving the RIS and jammer, thereby offering significant practical value. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) has been the primary positioning solution for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) due to their worldwide coverage, high precision and lightweight receivers. However, GNSS is prone to electromagnetic interference and malicious assaults, including jamming or spoofing because of its low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To ensure the continuity and protection of UAV operations, using redundant navigation systems is essential. In recent years, the phased array radio system (PARS) has established itself as a local navigation solution. PARS is robust towards malicious assaults because of an much higher SNR than GNSS regarding directed and encrypted transmission. An essential factor of PARS is that the orientation of the radio antenna at a ground station needs to be precisely determined to obtain the correct positioning of UAVs. This paper presents a method for extending a previously proposed calibration algorithm to estimate the ground antenna orientation with an inertial navigation system (INS) aided by redundant positioning sensors (GNSS, PARS or barometer) using a multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF) so that the calibration can be activated during flights whenever GNSS is available. In other words, the proposed navigation system is essentially an aided-INS which switches between two modes depending on the availability of GNSS: calibration and GNSS aiding mode when GNSS is available (Mode 1) and PARS and barometer aiding mode when GNSS is unavailable (Mode 2). Considering that the navigation system needs to include the effect of Earth’s curvature for a long-distance flight, PARS horizontal measurement and the barometer measurement were treated independently, and the navigation equations were propagated in Earth Centred Earth Fixed (ECEF) frame. The independent treatment of barometer measurement, and the propagation in ECEF frame were also beneficial when using multiple ground antennas to have a common reference point and reference frame. The proposed method was validated using data (Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), GNSS, PARS, Pixhawk autopilot (including barometer) measurements) collected during a field test. In the validation, GNSS was made available at the middle of the flight and the calibration mode was activated for 200s. The proposed navigation system successfully estimated the precise orientation of multiple ground antennas and the navigation solutions were verified using GNSS and Pixhawk autopilot solutions as ground truth. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The combination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mobile edge computing (MEC) is considered as a promising approach to tackle soaring computing requirements. The broadcast nature of air-to-ground (A2G) links makes UAV communications vulnerable to eavesdroppers, so secure UAV communications remain an open question. This paper proposes a secure communication scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted UAV-MEC systems, in which the RIS assists the user in offloading data to the legitimate UAV, and the legitimate UAV provides computing services to the user. To fully expand the security computing capacity of the system, the communication link is improved by introducing RIS, and the jammer interferes with the eavesdropper. The secure computing capability of the system is maximized by optimizing communication resources and trajectories. Since the proposed problem is non-convex, successive convex approximation (SCA) technique and block coordinate descent (BCD) technique is combined to solve the problem. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme in this paper can effectively improve the system secure computing bits compared with the benchmark scheme. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - The integration of electronic reconnaissance platforms and payloads in the electromagnetic and spatial domains of cognition is necessary for the successful execution of cognitive electronic reconnaissance missions. However, in partially observable environments, platforms and payloads interact in separate operational domains, making it a challenge for the model. The authors create a theoretical model of cognitive electronic reconnaissance, present an analysis method of model elements and derives adequate requirements for optimal radiation source sorting or recognition. Then, a 3D cognitive reconnaissance simulator ‘Scouter’ to simulate the dynamic interaction process of space electronic reconnaissance missions is developed and a deep reinforcement learning framework to optimise the electronic reconnaissance strategies of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is designed. For the first time, a method for judging reconnaissance area coverage using a behavioural angle is proposed. This method enables a deep reinforcement learning-based UAV with better reconnaissance behaviours and to realise the stable targeting of the target by the receiving antenna beam during reconnaissance. Moreover, the fast convergence of UAV agent training is ensured through the normalisation of partially observable status and reward shaping. Verified by adequate numerical simulations, a trained UAV can complete a 100 reconnaissance cycles mission with a completion rate of 91.9%. Even after the reconnaissance cycles are prolonged to 600, the mission completion rate can still be maintained at 78.5%. The most satisfying aspect is that the UAV comprehends the idea of reconnaissance and behaves in a way that is typical of it, such as by reciprocating or circling the edge of the radar's detecting power. © 2023 The Authors.

T2  - Journal of Testing and Evaluation
AB  - This article presents a set of nondestructive test methodologies designed to evaluate and compare performance of the communication links used for control and telemetry of small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) (drones) that are operating indoors and in subterranean environments. Such a set of standardized test methodologies does not yet exist. Indoor and subterranean operation requires sUAS to operate without global positioning system and often in a spatially constrained non-line-of-sight (NLOS) communication environment. Operating in constrained indoor environments puts additional constraints on the communication links and requires a set of tests to allow evaluation and comparison of different units in typical scenarios that will be encountered. Tests to measure and compare communication link performance and ability to pilot in tunnels and office type buildings with doors, walls, and other obstructions, as well as stairwells are described. The test methods consist of measuring and comparing the NLOS radio range between the sUAS and the ground control station or operator control unit (OCU), observing the sUAS behavior with partial or total communication failure. Near the edge of coverage, correlated packet loss can lead to difficulties in piloting. A methodology for evaluating video latency that is critical for remote piloting by camera only is presented. Finally, a test methodology for characterizing the effects of interference and jamming by waveforms such as Wi-Fi often encountered in buildings is described. These test methodologies described here extend standards developed for ground robots to three dimensions. The test methodologies described in this article are part of a multifaceted project that evaluates many essential elements of drone operation indoors. These include communication, navigation, collision tolerance, mapping, trust, and automation. The test methodologies are designed to be reproduced in user facilities. © © 2023 by ASTM International.

TI  - Resilient Path Planning of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Against Covert Attacks on Ultrawideband Sensors
AU  - He, Jiayi
AU  - Gong, Xin
T2  - IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics
AB  - In this article, a resilient path planning scheme is proposed to navigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to its planned (nominal) destination with minimum energy consumption in the presence of a strategic attacker. The UAV is equipped with the following two sensors: 1) a GPS sensor, which is vulnerable to spoofing attacks; 2) a well-functioning ultrawideband (UWB) sensor, which is possible to be deceived. It is shown that a covert attacker can significantly deviate the UAV's path without being detected by the UWB sensor by simultaneously corrupting the GPS signals and forging control inputs. The prerequisite for the attack occurrence is first discussed. Based on this prerequisite, an optimal attack scheme is proposed, which maximizes the deviation between the nominal destination and the real one. Correspondingly, an energy-efficient and resilient navigation scheme based on Pontryagin's maximum principle is formulated, which suppresses the above covert attacker effectively. Essentially, this problem can be seen as a Stackelberg game between a resilient path planner (defender) and a covert attacker. The effectiveness of our theoretical results is illustrated via two simulation examples. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we propose and analyze the maximal secrecy capability of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based relay non-orthogonal multiple access system. In this system, a UAV acts as an aerial relay station to assist transmission from a source to two users in the presence of a terrestrial eavesdropper and a friendly jamming UAV. The minimum achievable secrecy rate (MASR) of two users is derived as a metric indicator to quantify the security of the system under the assumption that the location of the eavesdropper is imprecise. In order to maximize MASR, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize system parameters, i.e., the trajectory of UAVs, transmit and jamming powers, as well as power allocation factors. Since the objective function and constraints of the total problem are non-convex, the successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent techniques are applied to find efficient approximate solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the MASR of the system compared to benchmark schemes. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Visual navigation based on image matching has become one of the most important research fields for UAVs to achieve autonomous navigation, because of its low cost, strong anti-jamming ability, and high performance. Currently, numerous positioning and navigation methods based on visual information have been proposed for UAV navigation. However, the appearance, shape, color, and texture of objects can change significantly due to different lighting conditions, shadows, and surface coverage during different seasons, such as vegetation cover in summer or ice and snow cover in winter. These changes pose greater challenges for feature-based image matching methods. This encouraged us to overcome the limitations of previous works, which did not consider significant seasonal changes such as snow-covered UAV aerial images, by proposing an image matching method using season-changing UAV aerial images and satellite imagery. Following the pipeline of a two-channel deep convolutional neural network, we first pre-scaled the UAV aerial images, ensuring that the UAV aerial images and satellite imagery had the same ground sampling distance. Then, we introduced attention mechanisms to provide additional supervision for both low-level local features and high-level global features, resulting in a new season-specific feature representation. The similarity between image patches was calculated using a similarity measurement layer composed of two fully connected layers. Subsequently, we conducted template matching to estimate the UAV matching position with the highest similarity. Finally, we validated our proposed method on both synthetic and real UAV aerial image datasets, and conducted direct comparisons with previous popular works. The experimental results demonstrated that our method achieved the highest matching accuracy on multi-temporal and multi-season images. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided augmented reality (AR) has developed rapidly in recent years and has become a promising technology in disaster rescue, transportation, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. However, the information leakage is challenging the usage of UAV-aided AR systems with wireless communications. In this article, a dual UAVs assisted covert communication system (CCS) is proposed, where one UAV transmits the covert message to ground receivers and a cooperative UAV performs as a jammer to interfere with the malicious eavesdropper. However, flying UAVs result in fast channel fading between the UAVs and ground nodes, which reduces the covert rate of the CCSs. To maximize the average covert rate, we formulated a non-convex optimization problem under the constraint that the detection error probability (DEP) of the monitor is minimum. Furthermore, the problem is decomposed into three subproblems and transformed into convex, and these subproblems are solved alternately by designing an iterative algorithm. Simulation results reveal that the average covert rate performance of the proposed optimization algorithm can respectively achieve 16% and 40% gains than those without covert constraint and without the cooperative UAV used as a jammer. © 2007-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Space-air-aqua integrated network (SAAIN) is an emerging maritime network architecture to support reliable and timely communications. Considering the computation capability and information security in maritime transportation systems, this work proposes a double-edge secure offloading scheme, where both base-station (BS) and satellites provide secure mobile-edge computing services for delay-sensitive applications. Specifically, maritime mobile users may offload their computation tasks adaptively to the BS or satellites securely relayed by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To minimize offloading delay, we formulate an optimization problem to allocate the transmit power cooperatively via UAVs' trajectory optimization. Moreover, jamming UAVs are deployed to protect the offloading process. For such a nonconvex optimization problem, two iterative algorithms are proposed to determine the transmit power and design the UAVs' trajectories. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of offloading delay. © 2014 IEEE.

TI  - ENHANCING ACCURACY OF INFORMATION PROCESSING IN ONBOARD SUBSYSTEMS OF UAVS
AU  - Zhukov, Igor A.

T2  - Technology Audit and Production Reserves
AB  - The object of research is the onboard subsystems of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The research is aimed at analyzing UAVs, specifically the integration and enhancement of satellite-based positioning systems, including Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). The problem concerns traditional satellite-based positioning services, especially those relying solely on medium earth orbit (MEO) satellites, which are insufficient for specific requirements. The study aims to address the limitations of these systems on onboard subsystems of UAVs, especially in challenging environments laden with jammers and interference, and to provide a more accurate, robust, and continuous positioning solution. The research proposes a «multilayer system of systems» approach that integrates signals from various sources, including low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, ground-based positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems, and user-centric sensors. The combined approach, termed LeGNSS/INS, leverages the strengths of each component, providing redundancy and enhanced accuracy. The system’s performance was evaluated using pseudo-real output data, demonstrating its ability to generate quasi-real dynamic trajectories for UAV flight. The error analysis showed that the proposed method consistently outperforms traditional GNSS systems, especially in challenging environments. The enhanced performance of the LeGNSS/INS system can be attributed to integrating multiple satellite systems with INS and applying optimal filtering techniques. The research also employed mathematical modeling to represent the dependencies and interactions when combining data from different sources, such as GPS, LEO, and INS. The Kalman filter is a mechanism to fuse data from multiple sources optimally. The insights from this study apply to various sectors, including aviation, maritime navigation, autonomous drones, and defense. The enhanced positioning accuracy can significantly improve safety, navigation precision, and operational efficiency. However, the study assumes idealized conditions for satellite signal reception, which might not always be accurate in real-world scenarios. Challenges, such as the martial law conditions in Ukraine affecting data collection and potential satellite signal restrictions, were also highlighted. Further research can delve into the impact of more complex environmental factors and the integration of additional satellite systems or sensors to enhance accuracy further. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - A multi-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-aided secure communication network is studied, where multiple information UAVs carrying temporary aerial base stations transmit confidential information to multiple authorized receivers (ARs), and a jammer UAV is employed to send artificial noise to multiple unauthorized receivers (URs) for mitigating information leakage. Some practical constrains including the inter-UAV interference among the information UAVs and the jammer UAV, the maximal available propulsion energy at UAVs, and the curvature radius limitations of UAVs' trajectories are concurrently taken into account. In order to maximize the minimum secrecy rate among the ARs, the AR scheduling, the UAVs' power allocation and the trajectories of UAVs are jointly optimized by formulating a multi-variable optimization problem. To solve the non-convex problem efficiently, we present a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based approach, where the penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is designed to optimize the AR scheduling, and successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to optimize the UAVs' power allocation and the trajectories of UAVs. The complexity of the presented BCD-based approach is analyzed, which achieves polynomial complexity. Simulation results show that imposing curvature radius limitations on the UAVs' trajectory design is effective to avoid sharp turning of UAVs. Moreover, as curvature radius increases, the system max-min secrecy rate decreases. Besides, the secrecy rate performance of the system can be enhanced by exploiting one jammer UAV to interfere with the URs. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we study a novel joint information-theoretic secrecy and covertness model for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted finite blocklength transmission system, in which an UAV delivers classified information to a ground user (Bob) in the presence of two unauthorized users (Eve and Willie). Specifically, Eve tries to decode the legitimate information while Willie tries to detect if the UAV's transmission is present or not. Firstly, we assume that the perfect location knowledge of both Eve and Willie is known at the UAV. In this scenario, to guarantee security and covertness, the average secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated via joint design of the UAV's transmit power and three dimensional (3D) trajectory under Willie's covertness constraint. Technically speaking, the optimization problem is non-convex and mathematically intractable to tackle owing to the coupling of multiple variables. To address this non-convex problem, an iterative alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed with the assistance of the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. After that, we extend the system model to both Eve's and Willie's imperfect location knowledge case, which is more sophisticated compared to the perfect location knowledge case due to the uncertain location constraints. We still utilize the iterative AO algorithm combined with SCA and S-procedure techniques to cope with the nonconvex problem. Numerical results indicate that our proposed 3D optimization algorithm performs better than the conventional two dimensional (2D) scheme and the benchmark scheme for both perfect and imperfect location knowledge cases. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The Internet of Drones (IoD) is a network paradigm where drones will fly over well-defined airways. The Jamming Attack (JA) poses a severe risk to IoD, affecting the drone's trajectory. Although JA has been investigated in UAV-based networks, the current solutions consider the airspace free to fly, whereas IoD allows drones to fly over constrained airspace, named airways. This study investigates the impact of JA over IoD, mainly regarding the drone path planning and, therefore, the drone trajectory. Also, we conduct a thorough discussion regarding the current challenges. To overcome these challenges, we propose the IoD-JAPM, an airway-aware protection mechanism against JA on the IoD, ranging from analyzing the airway's availability to the potential reformulation of the drone path planning. We perform an experimental evaluation through simulations to compare IoD-JAPM with a baseline solution and an existing approach that considers the airspace free to fly, varying the IoD topology and the number of jammers in the environment. We analyze four different metrics to measure at what level IoD-JAPM can mitigate a JA. Through the results, we observe a relation between the impact of JA on the drone path planning and the robustness of the topology, where the more restricted the topology, the more impact JA causes. Also, IoD-JAPM mitigates the effects of JA on path planning, causing few reformulations or even flight cancellations. Specifically, IoD-JAPM prevents all drones from being attacked when the environment has one jammer and mitigates the attack at 30% for two jammers. Furthermore, IoD-JAPM overcomes the baseline study regarding the increasing drone flight distance, and power consumption. Since the drone propellers affect most of the drone battery, the more the flight distance the more the power consumption. Also, the results reinforce that “free-to-fly” approaches cannot be applied in airway-oriented environments with strong jamming signals. In a nutshell, IoD-JAPM represents a robust protection mechanism against JA considering the aerial space defined through airways, advancing the state of the art of IoD-based protection mechanisms against JA. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This letter investigates an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted satellite-terrestrial communication network. Specifically, a three-dimensional mobile UAV helps to enhance coverage and simultaneously enable secure communication between the satellite and ground users with the internal eavesdropper. Moreover, non-orthogonal multiple access protocol is adopted, such that the spectral efficiency can be further improved. Aiming to maximize the secrecy rate, a joint cooperative jamming, transmit power, and UAV trajectory optimization problem is proposed. To deal with its non-convexity, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm that first optimally addresses the jamming and transmit power optimization in close forms and then uses an iterative relaxation technique to design the UAV trajectory for the given power. Simulation results highlight the critical role of the mobile UAV and significantly confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm over the benchmark schemes. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled air-ground integrated communication systems are vulnerable to jamming attack, mainly due to the high probability with line-of-sight wireless channel conditions. Although a few UAV anti-jamming transmission schemes have been recently proposed, the fundamental performance limits by simultaneously considering the UAV and jammer's mobility have not yet been reported. These observations motivate us to formulate an interactive reward region (IRR) characterization problem for the scenario that the UAV and the jammer compete with each other to maximize their respective rewards via power and mobility control. Then, we propose a transmit and jamming power optimization algorithm to characterize the IRR with power control, by leveraging successive convex approximation technique, where two transmit power design schemes are given in closed-form expressions from a game-theoretic perspective. Furthermore, the IRR with joint power and mobility control is characterized based on alternating optimization, in which both the UAV and jammer can simultaneously adjust their power and trajectories. Finally, extensive simulation results reveal that joint transmit power and trajectory optimization can enlarge the IRR, and increasing the UAV mobility and flight time length improves the UAV reward. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The navigation of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) mainly depends on global positioning systems (GPSs). However, GPSs are vulnerable to attack by spoofing, which causes the UAVs to lose their positioning ability. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning method to detect the spoofing of GPS signals received by small UAVs. Firstly, we describe the GPS signal dataset acquisition and preprocessing methods; these include the hardware system of the UAV and the jammer used in the experiment, the time and weather conditions of the data collection, the use of Spearman correlation coefficients for preprocessing, and the use of SVM-SMOTE to solve the spoofing data imbalance. Next, we introduce a PCA-CNN-LSTM model. We used principal component analysis (PCA) of the model to extract feature information related to spoofing from the GPS signal dataset. The convolutional neural network (CNN) in the model was used to extract local features in the GPS signal dataset, and long short-term memory (LSTM) was used as a posterior module of the CNN for further processing and modeling. To minimize randomness and chance in the simulation experiments, we used the 10-fold cross-validation method to train and evaluate the computational performance of our spoofing machine learning model. We conducted a series of experiments in a numerical simulation environment and evaluated the proposed model against the most advanced traditional machine learning and deep learning models. The results and analysis show that the PCA-CNN-LSTM neural network model achieved the highest accuracy (0.9949). This paper provides a theoretical basis and technical support for spoofing detection for small-UAV GPS signals. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The dynamic development of microelectronics and wireless communication at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries contributed to the increase in the availability and popularity of all kinds of unmanned platforms, air, land, surface, and underwater. In the case of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also popularly known as drones, the significant (crucial) advantages are high freedom of motion (i.e., the ability to move in three planes) and the possibility of using it practically anywhere (as opposed to water platforms). These factors influenced the dynamic development of this market sector and the high availability of various models and equipment. UAVs are being used in many sectors and services, both for civil and military purposes. Widespread availability, low cost, and ease of use also favor the possibility of using civilian UAVs for criminal, smuggling, terrorist, or military purposes. Recent armed conflicts, e.g., in Nagorno‐Karabakh or Ukraine, and the situation on the eastern Polish‐Belarusian border clearly show this. All countries recognize the potential and threat posed by the development of unmanned platforms. Therefore, for several years, special attention has been paid to analyses and research in sensors, effectors, and anti‐drone systems. It is worth emphasizing that some effectors (e.g., jammers or spoofers) may significantly affect the navigation process of neighboring objects that use global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs). On the other hand, the use of anti‐drone systems is important, especially in the context of protecting institutions and facilities of companies, state administration (i.a., embassies, consulates), army, strategic importance objects (e.g., related to energy, chemical industry), or protection of mass events. In this paper, we present an overview of solutions available on the market and development directions in the field of anti‐drone technology. © 2023, Faculty of Navigation, Gdynia Maritime University.

AB  - Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are subject to multipath or jamming and spoofing attacks. Although there are many proposed solutions, not all of them are tested practically. In this paper, we present experimental evaluation of 2×2 antenna array configuration with beamforming driven by software-defined radio (SDR) for multipath mitigation. The proposed system performs spatial filtering of multipath coming from other directions than the direct satellite signals. For satellite direction estimation satellite ephemeris data is used. Several scenarios with different degree of multipath are studied. The use of beamforming increases receiver's carrier-to-noise ratio up to about 8 dB and allows visibility of more GNSS satellites. Assembled from the low cost equipment such GNSS receiver could be used in many practical applications such as Internet of things devices or unmanned aerial vehicles. © 2022 COSPAR

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can serve as aerial base stations for users due to their flexibility, low cost, and other characteristics. However, due to the high flight position of UAVs, the air-to-ground (ATG) channels usually dominate with line-of-sight (LoS), which can be easily eavesdropped by multiple eavesdroppers. This poses a challenge to secure communication between UAVs and ground users. In this paper, we study a UAV-aided secure communication in an urban scenario where a legitimate UAV Alice transmits confidential information to a legitimate user Bob on the ground in the presence of several eavesdroppers around it and a UAV Jammer sends artificial noise to interfere with the eavesdroppers. We aim to maximize the physical layer secrecy rates in the system by jointly optimizing the trajectories of UAVs and their transmitting power. Considering the time-varying characteristics of channels, this problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). An improved algorithm based on double-DQN is proposed in the paper to solve this MDP problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can converge quickly under different environments, and the UAV transmitter and UAV jammers can find the optimal location correctly to maximize the information secrecy rate. It also shows that the double-DQN (DDQN) based algorithm works better than the Q-learning and deep Q-learning network (DQN). © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - A multitude of applications based on unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs), in conjunction with the UAVs' diminishing costs and increasing capabilities, present a major threat to public safety as well as critical infrastructure security, leading to the need for versatile and robust counter-drone solutions. This work presents a novel multi-agent jamming system, where a group of cooperative autonomous agents employ various algorithms (detection, tracking, jamming, and self-localization) to counter unauthorized drone operations. The proposed system employs a joint wireless jamming and cooperative positioning framework to best track and intercept the moving rogue drone, utilizing a relative positioning system based on signals of opportunity in conjunction with inertial and vision measurements. Software-defined radio technology is incorporated on the pursuer agent to achieve rogue drone GPS disruption, while at the same time the autonomous agents cooperate to compute the location estimate of the pursuer agent. In the presence of jamming, to improve the wireless communication performance of the autonomous agents, a cellular communication architecture is also used as an additional channel for control and information exchange. For evaluation purposes, a prototype multi-agent system is designed, implemented, and tested in a real-world environment to demonstrate its enhanced localization and jamming performance, when compared to single-agent approaches. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Based on the high positioning accuracy, low cost and low-power consumption, the ultra-wide-band (UWB) is an ideal solution for indoor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization and navigation. However, the UWB signals are easy to be blocked or reflected by obstacles such as walls and furniture. A resilient tightly-coupled inertial navigation system (INS)/UWB integration is proposed and implemented for indoor UAV navigation in this paper. A factor graph optimization (FGO) method enhanced by resilient stochastic model is established to cope with the indoor challenging scenarios. To deal with the impact of UWB non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals and noise uncertainty, the conventional neural net-works (CNNs) are introduced into the stochastic modelling to improve the resilience and reliability of the integration. Based on the status that the UWB features are limited, a ‘two-phase’ CNNs structure was designed and implemented: one for signal classification and the other one for measurement noise prediction. The proposed resilient FGO method is tested on flighting UAV platform under actual indoor challenging scenario. Compared to classical FGO method, the overall positioning errors can be decreased from about 0.60 m to centimeter-level under signal block and reflection scenarios. The superiority of resilient FGO which effectively verified in constrained environment is pretty important for positioning accuracy and integrity for indoor navigation task. © 2022 China Ordnance Society

AB  - This paper proposes a feature fusion algorithm for solving the path planning problem of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) using GPS and communication denial conditions. Due to the blockage of GPS and communication, UAVs cannot obtain the precise position of a target, which leads to the failure of path planning algorithms. This paper proposes a feature fusion proximal policy optimization (FF-PPO) algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL); the algorithm can fuse image recognition information with the original image, realizing the multi-UAV path planning algorithm without an accurate target location. In addition, the FF-PPO algorithm adopts an independent policy for multi-UAV communication denial environments, which enables the distributed control of UAVs such that multi-UAVs can realize the cooperative path planning task without communication. The success rate of our proposed algorithm can reach more than 90% in the multi-UAV cooperative path planning task. Finally, the feasibility of the algorithm is verified by simulations and hardware. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The combination of nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides an effective solution for achieving massive connections and improving spectrum efficiency. However, the related security risk becomes serious due to the line-of-sight (LoS) channels involved and high transmit power for weaker users in NOMA-UAV networks. In this article, a UAV-assisted NOMA transmission scheme is proposed to achieve secure downlink transmission via artificial jamming, where a UAV flies straightly to serve multiple ground users in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. During the flight, only the closest NOMA users are chosen to connect with the UAV in each time slot to achieve high LoS probability. To balance the security and transmission performance, the tradeoff between the jamming power and the sum rate is investigated by jointly optimizing the power allocation, the user scheduling and the UAV trajectory. The formulated problem is mixed-integer and nonconvex due to the coupled variables. To address this, we first decompose the problem into two subproblems of power allocation and trajectory optimization. Then, they are transformed into convex ones via the first-order Taylor expansion. After that, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the convex problem. Finally, numerical results show that the security of the network is well enhanced and verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2007-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In order to solve the problem of distributed cooperative jamming task allocation of UAV swarm, an optimal allocation method based on improving the cover efficiency of manned aircraft is proposed. Firstly, based on the cooperative interference of multiple UAVs, a model of common detection exposure area of networked radar is established.Then, according to the concept of safety zone in the jamming effectiveness evaluation criterion, a more objective and comprehensive jamming evaluation function model is established by combining the shortest distance between the manned aircraft and the exposed area boundary, the feasible area range for the manned aircraft to plan the safe track in the next step and the degree of suppression of the radar exposed area. Finally, based on the multi-pheromone ant colony algorithm, the adjustment and improvement are made to adjust the pheromone learning rate and path planning strategy more intelligently, improve the model optimization rate and optimization ability, and give the specific implementation logic. Through simulation, it is found that this method has more stable and fast convergence ability than traditional genetic algorithm, and has stronger global optimization ability than traditional ant colony algorithm. Especially With the expansion of operation scale, the convergence performance of the algorithm is more prominent, and it has better real-time operation and can be closer to practical application. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This paper aims to maximize the sum throughput of an Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS)-assisted wireless powered communication network (WPCN), where the IRS located between several sensors and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The system first performs wireless power transfer to the sensors and then assists forwarding the information of each sensor to the UAV based on TDMA protocol. To address each problem's non-convexity, we propose an algorithm to obtain the nearoptimal solution. The method of block coordinate descent is used to improve the throughput through joint optimization of allocation of time slot, transmit power of ground nodes, phase shifts of the IRS, and trajectory of the UAV.

AU  - Mohan, Jaya Preethi
AU  - Ranganathan, Prakash
AB  - Global Positioning System (GPS) is critical for precise navigation of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) trajectory planning. GPS signals may experience sudden or intermittent interference due to multi-path fading, spoofing, jamming, or difficult terrain environments leading to 'dropout' phenomena. The paper models one such dropout scenario by injecting false data into original GPS timestamps representing interference. We consider 'dropouts' as insertion of false GPS data (FDI). The end goal is to investigate the performance of FDI detection rates using several clustering algorithms: 1) Density-Based Spatial Clustering, 2) Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure, 3) Gaussian mixture models, and 4) Hierarchical Clustering. Multiple grouping indices such as Silhouette Coefficient (SC) and David Bouldin's (DB) Index were used to evaluate normal vs. abnormal points grouping. The preliminary results are mixed indicating that the OPTICS clustering algorithm outperforms for scenario 3, while scenarios 1 and 2 are challenging for any clustering methods to capture the injected points. Also, SC is a good metric over DB index to evaluate the cluster groups. This paper also investigated non-clustering approach such as Isolation forest, which seems to be a better candidate for such FDI detection. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Now-a-days, drones become increasingly popular for various applications, including surveillance, delivery, and inspection. However, they are vulnerable to attacks, especially GPS spoofing and jamming, which can disrupt their GPS signals and cause them to crash. In response, academic research has proposed various methods for detecting and mitigating these attacks, such as using multiple GPS receivers, inertial navigation systems, and statistical analysis of GPS signals. Beyond GPS attacks, cybersecurity for drones is a broader issue that includes denial-of-service attacks, malware attacks, and physical attacks on the drone itself. These attacks can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of drone systems, posing significant risks to operators and the public. To address these threats, ongoing research and development of countermeasures are needed, as new and more sophisticated attacks may continue to emerge as technology advances. The development of effective countermeasures requires collaboration among academia, industry, and government agencies to ensure that drone systems are robust, resilient, and secure against cyber and physical attacks. Additionally, regulations and standards must be established to ensure the safe and secure operation of drones, including cybersecurity requirements that mandate secure communication, authentication, and encryption protocols. In summary, the increasing use of drones in various applications highlights the importance of addressing the cybersecurity challenges that arise from their use. The development of effective countermeasures to GPS spoofing, jamming, and other attacks is critical to ensuring the safety and security of drone systems, operators, and the public. Ongoing research and collaboration among stakeholders are essential to achieving this goal and to mitigating the risks associated with drone operations. © 2023 IEEE.

However, GPS technology is vulnerable to spoofing and jamming attacks due to its open design, which can have significant consequences. To mitigate the vulnerability of GPS technology to spoofing and jamming attacks, this paper proposes a subspace projection-based mitigation scheme. The scheme involves a systematic approach in which the line signal is projected to an orthogonal subspace and used in the conventional Direction of Arrival estimation using Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm.

AB  - Cognitive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication systems combine benefits of both the cognitive radio and UAV, which improves the spectral efficiency and communication coverage area. However, high-quality air-ground channel links maybe more vulnerable to potential eavesdropping or jamming attacks. Thus, this paper proposes a secure transmission approach assisted by deploying a cooperative UAV to transmit artificial noise to jam an active eavesdropper, in order to maximize the system secrecy rate under the quality of service (QoS) requirement of a primary device. Specifically, we jointly optimize the flight trajectory and transmission power of the cooperative jammer to maximize the system's secrecy rate under strict constraints. To achieve this, we convert the non-convex problem into an approximately convex problem using the block coordinate descent algorithm and successive convex approximation method. Simulation results show that compared to existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm in this study can significantly improve the system's secrecy rate. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are vulnerable to several threats that lead to security problems, such as stealing video footage, artificial signal interference, jamming and spoofing. Any system that rely on satellite positioning technology can be targeted by spoofing to generate incorrect positioning / timing, which is accomplished by inserting false signals into the victim's receiver. For example, the attacker inserts different positioning coordinates in the system that will hijack or distract security / safety in airspace surveillance. The civil aircraft's signal is not unencrypted and easily spoofed. When spoofing occurs, the target UAV deviates from the original path, and the UAV flies to the target point. Hence, this paper investigates the preliminary effects of spoofing signals on a Garmin GPSMAP 66SR handheld GNSS receiver and a DJI Phantom UAV. The test was conducted via field measurements at an open area with GNSS spoofing signals generated using a GNSS simulator with increasing power levels from-140 to-95 dBm. It was found that the GNSS receiver was spoofed at-116 dBm, while for the UAV, the spoofing signal affected the navigation system as it showed abnormal operation and had to be flown using optical mode for navigation during the spoofing period and changed back to GNSS mode. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The combination of Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mobile edge computing (MEC) can efficiently alleviate the computing burden caused by enormous data flow in the context of 6G, especially for the latency-sensitive and computation-intensive tasks in some remote scenarios without available infrastructure. However, the security of information transmitted from ground to air through line-of-sight (LoS) wireless channels remains a major concern due to their broadcast nature. To address this issue, this work studies a secure UAV-assisted MEC system, where a UAV functions as a MEC node to provide computation service for the ground users, while the other UAV functions as a jammer to inject signals to the ground eavesdropper (EV) with an imperfectly known position. The overall energy consumption, encompassing computation, communication, and UAV flight, is minimized under resource limitations. This is achieved through the joint optimization of user transmit power, task allocation for computation, and trajectories for UAVs. Due to the non-convex of the formulated problem, which pertains to the interdependence of various variables in a nonlinear manner, we propose a double-layered robust task allocation and trajectory optimization (RTATO) algorithm. In the first layer, we optimize task and power allocation using the Taylor expansion method. In the second layer, UAV trajectory scheduling is optimized using the slack variable method and successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Simulation results indicate that the algorithm we suggest significantly improves energy consumption in terms of robustness and security compared to benchmark schemes. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - With the growing adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) across various domains, the security of their operations is paramount. UAVs, heavily dependent on GPS navigation, are at risk of jamming and spoofing cyberattacks, which can severely jeopardize their performance, safety, and mission integrity. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are typically employed as defense mechanisms, often leveraging traditional machine learning techniques. However, these IDSs are susceptible to adversarial attacks that exploit machine learning models by introducing input perturbations. In this work, we propose a novel IDS for UAVs to enhance resilience against such attacks using generative adversarial networks (GAN). We also comprehensively study several evasion-based adversarial attacks and utilize them to compare the performance of the proposed IDS with existing ones. The resilience is achieved by generating synthetic data based on the identified weak points in the IDS and incorporating these adversarial samples in the training process to regularize the learning. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed IDS is significantly robust against adversarial machine learning-based attacks compared to the state-of-the-art IDSs while maintaining a low false positive rate. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - GNSS-based sequential positioning filters, such as Kalman Filters, are extensively used by land-based applications, such as rail-applications (Brocard, P. (2016)), automotive (European GNSS Agency (2015)) and in other domains such as drones. GNSS and inertial navigation system (INS) hybridization schemes through Kalman filters are also of interest for civil aviation for robustness against jamming and spoofing. In addition, there is a growing interest for land-based applications to fulfill medium to high integrity requirements while maintaining good availability performances. This is because most of these applications are safety-related or liability-related applications. Satellite based augmentation system (SBAS) is currently used by safety-related applications (such as civil aviation) since it delivers ionospheric and/or GNSS satellite orbit and clock corrections, along with integrity bounds on the SBAS residual errors and integrity flags on SBAS products. This enables SBAS users to compute integrity bounds in the position domain, and to fulfill integrity requirements. However, integrity information contained in current and future SBAS messages are designed for user applying snapshot positioning filters that are Weighted Least Square filters. In order to prepare the extension of SBAS to users applying Kalman Filters for high integrity applications, it is of interest to identify SBAS satellite orbit and clock residual error model adapted to time-recursive filters. The goals of this work are to propose a methodology to develop such model and to identify the main parameters influencing the model values. This methodology is targeted for the EGNOS next generation, but is applied in this paper on the European SBAS system (EGNOS V3) dual-frequency satellite orbit and clock residual errors in order to get first EGNOS V3 error model adapted to Kalman Filters. Simulation results presented in this paper provide the model values for the different GPS satellites and assess their sensitivity with respect to the user location in the integrity coverage. © 2023 Proceedings of the 36th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2023.

AU  - Rudnik, Philipp

AU  - Cuntz, Manuel
AB  - The multi-antenna Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver GALileo ANTenna (GALANT) has been developed at German Aerospace Center (DLR) since several years. Recently, effort has been spent to miniaturize the antennas and digital processing system in order to enable applications in the field of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation for example. In addition, array processing technologies have been further improved for this kind of application. This publication focuses on the conduction of flight test of the complete system and the therein occurring advantages towards a commercial receiver in difficult navigation scenarios like under the influence of jamming. The flight experiments are divided into two parts. Firstly, it is investigated how the different receivers react to corresponding jamming from the ground while the receiver is not moving, but is hovering close to the ground. During this experiment, the jamming power is increased step by step. The reference receiver goes into saturation, gradually loses all satellites, the position accuracy drops and finally no valid Position/Velocity/Timing (PVT) can be computed. In contrast, the GALANT receiver detects the interference and suppresses it appropriately based on spatial signal processing techniques. In the second part of the experiments it is investigated how jamming signals emitted from ground affect the receiver during real flight scenarios. A static and directional jammer is set up and the UAV flies a trajectory passing multiple times through the beam. Interestingly the reference receiver does not only lose all satellites in track, like expected from the first experiment, but computes a false position increasingly diverging from ground truth before and after the total loss. The deviation of position is in the range of multiple hundred meters. The GALANT receiver is able to keep most of the satellites in track, and computes a continuous position with negligible deviation. The flight experiments conducted show that it is reasonable to protect UAVs appropriately against interference such as jamming. The tests also show that techniques, such as those presented, can be an effective solution to the stated problems. The developed robust, multi-antenna receiver outperformed the corresponding comparison receiver in the presented areas. © 2023 Proceedings of the 36th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2023.

AB  - Security in maritime ports is a complex problem given the particularity of these facilities, consisting of huge areas with many entry points operating constantly. This problem also involves risks that are linked to the use of technologies: the jamming and spoofing of GNSS signals can affect the operation of all GNSS-enabled vehicles operating in the port whereabouts (vessels and, potentially, drones). These issues have been identified by the maritime industry and, as a search for solutions, PASSport is a project that responds to port entities by extending situational awareness to improve safety and security in port areas. This is achieved through the combination of a fleet of drones with a network of RFI monitoring stations. The drone fleet is intended to provide an innovative operational support to the recognition, management and analysis of safety and security aspects of daily operations, introducing a real time dynamic surveillance solution. In order to ensure an accurate, secure and safe navigation, PASSport drones integrate GNSS receivers with dedicated capabilities to mitigate potential GNSS deficiencies in port operations, such as multipath or signal interferences. Given that most autopilots use GNSS information for navigation, the use of these capabilities is not only justified but necessary. These capabilities are, for accuracy, a PPP algorithm; for security, Galileo's OSNMA service; and for safety, the IBPL integrity approach. Off-board, additional support is introduced with the use of the interference detection system DIN℡/srx-10i. The purpose of this paper is to assess the functionalities of PPP, OSNMA and RFI monitoring in terms of robustness against spoofing attacks and accuracy of positioning obtained with authenticated navigation messages. These functionalities are validated with results obtained from different tests using real Signal-in-Space (SiS). These tests are performed in different European ports and locations, including Hamburg, Naples and Valencia. © 2023 Proceedings of the 36th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2023.

AB  - The emergence of applications such as autonomous vehicles and UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) has lately brought high precision positioning into the focus of the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) community. Simultaneously, such autonomous applications fall under the category of SoL (Safety of Life), applications and therefore require strict protection levels, high integrity, and resilience against GNSS interference. Protection and toughening of GNSS receivers against jamming and spoofing has been a heavily studied subject in the last decade. Literature has proven spatial signal processing algorithms combined with compact antenna arrays to show effectiveness in providing the required resilience. However, due to the large footprint of these arrays, the distribution of smaller subarrays has been considered more aesthetic by the industry and customers alike. Such distributed systems can be installed more discretely and in various synthetic parts of a vehicle. This paper studies such a distributed antenna subarray system in a series of real-world measurements under the use of carrier-phase based RTK (Real Time Kinematics) positioning. The goal of the paper is to meet the requirements of high precision and resilient positioning. A demonstration of sustained high precision positioning under jamming conditions is presented using spatial signal processing algorithms. A statistical analysis is carried out to compare single antenna processing approach against a multi-antenna spatial signal processing one. Assessment of a state-of-the-art carrier-phase compensation algorithm for spatial interference mitigation filter is made to study its benefits for RTK-based positioning using multi-antenna setups. © 2023 Proceedings of the 36th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2023.

AB  - Artificial intelligence algorithms, particularly machine learning, are used to effectively support autonomous flight decisions based on satellite navigation signals. These algorithms can learn to recognize various patterns in navigation data and use them to make decisions on flight direction, speed, and other parameters. In any case, a combination of various technologies such as artificial intelligence algorithms, navigation systems, sensors, and other tools is necessary to effectively support autonomous flight decisions based on satellite navigation signals.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming increasingly important for military operations, including reconnaissance, providing battlefield support, and performing a variety of missions. The possibility of attacking targets using a group of UAVs increases the relevance of protection measures, particularly camouflage. The literature review highlights the experience of using UAVs in military spheres of activity and their high efficiency in reconnaissance and support on the battlefield. Using high-resolution images, visual orientation on the terrain was considered a priority direction of UAV navigation in the operation of electronic warfare tools. Based on hybrid convolutional neural networks, hardware for working with the UAV platform is serially produced. Vines are suggested for masking stationary objects due to their rapid growth and the corresponding quality/cost ratio. The work aims to check the effectiveness of masking small objects using grassy and climbing (lianas) vegetation concerning the prospects of their identification by optical means. The research was conducted using our data obtained from UAVs in the visible range on experimental fields and the botanical hall of NUBiP of Ukraine and on pictures of buildings from the Internet. It has been experimentally established that vegetation's variety of shapes, sizes, and structures complicates the recognition process for convolutional neural networks. The appearance of plants can change significantly depending on the angle of photography, lighting, and the state of mineral nutrition. Organic camouflage in the form of grasses and vines can entirely or partially hide buildings and structures, changing their brightness and contour. This can obscure details and increase the risk of false object recognition. For example, facilities covered with ARISTOLOCHIA MANSHURIENSIS Kom vines were correctly recognized only 27% of the time using neural networks. Convolutional neural networks require a large amount of data to train if the goal is to achieve high accuracy. However, if data with vine-covered objects is limited or unavailable, the training process may need to be improved, affecting the network's ability to recognize such things accurately. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The vigorous development of maritime networks and the explosive growth of maritime sampling data put forward more and more high demands on the computing and communication capability of maritime equipment. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), as the mobile relay device guarantees the capability by transferring part of the computing tasks of maritime equipment to carrying mobile edge computing (MEC) servers on land. However, the transmitting data of the UAV's communication channel can be easily intercepted due to the line of sight (LoS) feature, which brings the secure data transmission issue. To solve this issue, we propose a secure data transmission scheme in the UAV-relay assisted maritime MEC system. Specifically, a malicious UAV attempts to intercept the transmission data while another UAV helps forward the offloading computational data to the maritime surface users. A ground jammer transmits jamming signals with the object to block data intercepting. To maximize the users' minimum secure calculation capacity, we jointly optimize the transmit power of users and the relay UAV, the time slot allocation factor, and the UAV flight trajectory with block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Numerical findings demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the secure calculation capability of the system compared with four benchmark schemes. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This paper investigates the use of artificial noise assistance to achieve covert communication between unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and ground users in the presence of illegal detector on the ground. Specifically, there is a UAV in the air that serves as a transmitting user and communicates with ground receiving user. In order to achieve covert information transmission, a friendly jammer is deployed on the ground to emit artificial noise and interfere with the detection of ground detector, thereby assisting in covert information transmission between the UAV and ground user. We aim to maximize the covert transmission rate through the joint optimization of UAV flight trajectory and transmit power. The optimization problem is a non-convex optimization problem and difficult to solve directly. We introduce relaxation variables to equivalently transform it into a more manageable problem, and design an alternating iterative optimization algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) technology to solve this optimization problem. The simulation results indicate that the joint optimization strategy and algorithm can effectively improve the covert transmission rate between UAV and ground user. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is of crucial importance for diverse practical applications. However, it is susceptible to the severe spectrum scarcity problem and interference since it operates in the unlicensed spectrum band. In order to tackle those issues, a dynamic spectrum sharing network is considered with the anti-jamming technique. Moreover, an intelligent spectrum allocation and trajectory optimization scheme is proposed to adapt to diverse jamming models by exploiting our designed novel online-offline multi-agent actor-critic and deep deterministic policy-gradient framework. Simulation results demonstrate the high efficiency of our proposed framework. It is also shown that our proposed scheme achieves the largest transmission rate among all benchmark schemes. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - UAV navigation and positioning research is critical to flight safety, complex environment response and aviation technology advancement. Global research has focused on multi-sensor fusion and visual navigation, but challenges such as positioning accuracy, multi-modal fusion and real-time performance still need to be addressed. Continued in-depth research will improve UAV positioning accuracy, environment awareness and autonomous navigation capabilities, and promote the expansion of UAV technology applications. This paper focuses on the advantages of radar and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), such as strong concealment and anti-jamming, which are one of the key equipments in modern military operations. The existing passive positioning methods have the defect of large target positioning error, which cannot meet the needs of today's warfare. Therefore, this study proposes a UAV positioning and formation analysis based on passive dual-station positioning and optimised models. The results show that the model proposed in this study has good robustness. © 2023 SPIE.

AU  - Jensen, Nikolas I.

AB  - This paper presents a localization system for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), specifically designed for small UAVs to be used in a GPS-denied local area by using estimation algorithms incorporating camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor fusion. Localization techniques classically rely on Global Positioning System (GPS) information. However, GPS is subject to jamming. This paper proposes methods of localization without reliance on the GPS. This system utilizes Error-State Extended Kalman Filtering (ESEKF) and methods of camera to LiDAR sensor fusion to correct for error propagations in the aerial vehicle's estimated location. Initial results from the GPS-denied navigation method showed that the location of the sUAV to an average error of 3.2 m was possible using only texel images and velocity measurements from an experimental flight. © 2023 SPIE.

AB  - The article discusses the use of drones on the battlefield today. The topicality of the topic is primarily due to the conflict in Ukraine, where drones have been used since the beginning of the conflict. The article summarizes the various possibilities of using these means in reconnaissance or combat activities, as well as the different types of these means. Equipment developed for military use is used, but there are still conversions of originally purely civilian equipment for military use. However, all the means used have a common technical problem, and that is determining the location, which is crucial for the use of drones. For professional drones, it is an essential part of guidance using navigation systems. These positioning systems can be interfered with in various ways. Individual options are discussed in more detail. © 2023 IEEE.

AU  - Opitz, Felix
AB  - The benefits of using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) platform to perform certain tasks include increased robustness in the system, greater flexibility, reduced cost, as well as an increase in the speed of task completion. By acting collectively, a team of UAVs can quickly determine the approximate location of intermittently broadcasting RF emitters with simple passive angle-of-arrival sensors. Passive ground emitter location techniques are vital to electronic warfare system (EWS) providing threat warnings in hostile environments. The paper focuses on proposing and evaluating solutions for optimizing the UAV trajectories for localization of a RF emitter using Line of Bearing (LOB) measurements. The optimization approach aims to minimize the size of the target position error ellipse. A framework using only the geometry of the problem is explored to minimize the maximal bounds of the emitters' locations without using a belief or probability distribution needed for iterative approaches, which requires a good initial guess to ensure convergence on the true position. The effectiveness of the geometric approach is shown by designing and evaluating a global decision-making strategy based on Learning Real-Time A∗ (LRTA∗) algorithm. Through simulations, the search solution is compared to a conventional optimal control solution approach for a two dimensional space case. The LRTA∗ solution achieves acceptable accuracy with sufficient observation points and it is suitable for real-time purposes. The solution is also attractive for its capability to initialize iterative algorithms if needed. © 2023 German Institute of Navigation (DGON).

UAV s face severe challenges in flying in the complex electromagnetic space environment. Studing the electronic jamming at the soft-kill level of UAVs, establishes the UAV system model through the NetLogo multi-agent simulation software, builds the UAV flight environment, and uses MATLAB to establish a jammer model to carry out navigation signals and data links for UAVs interference. Use the NetLogo extension function to call MATLAB for interference simulation to simulate the behavior of the UAV under interference conditions.

AB  - To strengthen tracking in dynamic flight maneuvers the miniaturized real-time Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver GALileo ANTenna (GALANT), developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), has been equipped with a robust vector tracking algorithm. To harden the receiver the algorithm used on the platform excludes Non-Line-Of-Sight signals by exploiting spatial information gained by the 2×2 antenna array and its processing. This contribution focuses on the planning, execution and evaluation of the experimental validation of the receiver and its tracking algorithm by conduction of open field flight test in the rural area near Munich. The developed system was fitted as payload to a compact hexacopter and the potential benefits in signal tracking are investigated, while the algorithm relies on GNSS information only and uses no other sensor data input such as Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) or compass. The receiver has been developed to be resilient to intentional and unintentional interference from diverse origins based on spatial suppression of jamming sources, which has been proven in previous tests. Performing these techniques also suppresses satellite signals impinging from the direction of the interference source, which need to be recovered. To test the performance of the implemented vector tracking algorithm with respect to the signal recovery, the receiver is exposed to a jamming source on ground while changing the constellation. © 2023 IEEE.

TI  - RF Signal Source Search and Localization Using an Autonomous UAV with Predefined Waypoints
AU  - Kwon, Hyeokjun

AB  - Localization of a radio frequency (RF) signal source has various use cases, ranging from search and rescue, identification and deactivation of jammers, and tracking hostile activity near borders or on the battlefield. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for signal source search and localization (SSSL) can have significant advantages when compared to terrestrial-based approaches, due to the ease of capturing RF signals at higher altitudes and the autonomous 3D navigation capabilities of UAVs. However, the limited flight duration of UAVs due to battery constraints, as well as limited computational resources on board of lightweight UAVs introduce challenges for SSSL. In this paper, we study various SSSL techniques using a UAV with predefined waypoints.A linear least square (LLS) based localization scheme is considered with enhanced reference selection due to its relatively lower computational complexity. Five different LLS localization algorithms are proposed and studied for selecting anchor positions to be used for localization as the UAV navigates through an area. The performance of each algorithm is measured in two ways: 1) real-time positioning accuracy during the ongoing UAV flight, and 2) long-term accuracy measured at the end of the UAV flight. We compare and analyze the performance of the proposed approaches using computer simulations in terms of accuracy, UAV flight distance, and reliability. © 2023 IEEE.

TI  - Optimization of Localization Error in Multi-Agent Systems through Cooperative Positioning: Autonomous Navigation in Partially Denied GNSS Environments
AU  - Shahkar, Shahram
AU  - Khorasani, Khashayar
AB  - This paper proposes a novel navigation technique in multi-agent autonomous vehicles to improve network localization in a partially denied GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) environment, where at least one agent (referred to as the leader) has access to its actual position, and the GNSS denied part of the network tends to achieve consensus over the position of individual agents, based on the position of the leader. In a large network of autonomous vehicles (as in the Internet of Drones (IoD), or UGV traffic control) a fully-denied GNSS environment is rarely the case, as on one hand GNSS cyberattacks (including malicious jamming, spoofing, and meaconing) cannot affect extensive spaces (due to limited energy resources of adversaries), and on the other hand naturally obscured GNSS signals are often locally restricted features, and rarely span over vast geographic areas. This paper argues that if any anonymous agent in a connected network has access to GNSS, then all other agents could estimate their own locations by sensing their relative distance with respect to adjacent agents, and also exchanging their own estimated locations with respective neighbours, hence, accomplishing 'cooperative positioning'. It is shown that network localization is improved through optimization of its topology. © 2023 IEEE.

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security
AB  - In this paper, we investigate jamming-resilient UAV path planning strategies for data collection in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, in which the typical UAV can learn the optimal trajectory to elude such jamming attacks. Specifically, the typical UAV is required to collect data from multiple distributed IoT nodes under collision avoidance, mission completion deadline, and kinematic constraints in the presence of jamming attacks. We first design a fixed ground jammer with continuous jamming attack and periodical jamming attack strategies to jam the link between the typical UAV and IoT nodes. Defensive strategies involving a reinforcement learning (RL) based virtual jammer and the adoption of higher SINR thresholds are proposed to counteract against such attacks. Secondly, we design an intelligent UAV jammer, which utilizes the RL algorithm to choose actions based on its observation. Then, an intelligent UAV anti-jamming strategy is constructed to deal with such attacks, and the optimal trajectory of the typical UAV is obtained via dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN). Simulation results show that both non-intelligent and intelligent jamming attacks have significant influence on the UAV's performance, and the proposed defense strategies can recover the performance close to that in no-jammer scenarios. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant popularity and are used for many applications, from entertainment to surveillance and the modern battlefield. As regulation demands arose worldwide, controling and reacting to unauthorized flights of UAVs became a pressing issue. In this work, we present an algorithm to accelerate the training of a reinforcement learning drone agent for a counter unmanned aerial system (C-UAS). The main objective of this C-UAS is to guide an invading drone to a safe-killing zone (SZ) using a hunter quadrotor drone. The hunter quadrotor launches a spoofing, or meaconing, attack on the GNSS receiver of the invading drone. The proposed algorithms employ an abstraction of the C-UAS problem to accelerate the training step and enable training during the mission. Results for different SZ radii are discussed using a software-in-the-loop simulation for ground truth based on a detailed model of the UAV embedded system and flight dynamics, including error metrics and action time. We show that a 99% probability of successful target steering to the SZ can be achieved considering a SZ radius of 75 meters and a Q-table trained with the proposed accelerated training model. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - With the massive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in disaster relief, fire protection, security and other fields, jamming countermeasures to UAVs in airports and competition venues have become the core link of security in high-level matches and important places. The existing jamming sources are mainly single point jamming. Due to the shielding of buildings, it is impossible to fully cover the venue, and the existing suppressed jamming will affect the communication broadcasting. Here, a distributed optimal jamming method for massive UAVs is proposed. Through the identification and positioning of massive UAVs, using the location information of distributed jamming sources, the UAV jamming architecture based on satellite navigation is constructed. Combined with tabu search artificial bee colony theory, the distributed optimal jamming of UAVs is realized, which solves the problems of few jamming targets, slow speed and low success rate of the existing optimal jamming methods. The proposed method is compared with the existing methods in three aspects: communication frequency, jamming trajectory deviation and optimization speed. The simulation results show that the proposed method effectively improves the jamming success rate and jamming speed and can meet the application requirements of massive UAV jamming in the region. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The electromagnetic battlefield is the fifth-dimensional invisible battlefield above the tangible geographical battlefield of land, sea, air and sky. The integrated electronic warfare system is a killer to seize the right to control the electromagnetic properties of the system to the system and the organization to organization in modern war. Unmanned aerial vehicle has significant advantages in terms of endurance, combat distance and mobility, which are more suitable for application in electronic warfare. In this paper, a method of constructing an integrated EW system based on UAVs is proposed, which takes integrated design, integrated control, integrated management and comprehensive application as the core. The single platform is realized through the hardware integrated of general sensors, general antennas, general interfaces and general processers, as well as software drivers of flight management, load management, navigation management and platform management. The multiplatform is realized through satellite platforms, high-altitude and long-endurance UAVs, medium-altitude and long-endurance UAVs, medium-low altitude and long-endurance UAVs, vertical takeoff and landing UAVs, underwater UAVs, ground equipment and vehicle-mounted platforms. By means of combat classification commands, intelligence hierarchical processing and distributed confrontation to make each defense zone and each system can not only fight independently but also command cooperatively. The repeated use of force is reduced, the effective use of intelligence is improved, and the continuous combat force is ensured through the comprehensive management of three armed forces. Through the combination of peace and war, far and near, air and land, soft and hare, and true and false to maximize the effectiveness of integrated electronic warfare system most efficient.

AU  - Sharifi-Tehrani, Omid

AB  - Jamming and spoofing detection of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) is of great importance. Civil and military aerial platforms use GNSS as main navigation systems and these systems are main target of threat attacks. In this paper a simple method based on different empirical probability density functions of successive received signal powers and goodness of fit technique is proposed for airborne platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), in no fading environment. The two different paths between UAV-satellite and UAV-threat, experience different empirical probability density functions which can be used to distinguish between authentic and threat signals. Simulation results including detection and false alarm probabilities show good performance of proposed method as well as low computational burden. © 2022 Beijing Institute of Technology.

AB  - This paper studies a mobile jammer enabled secure unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication network in the finite packet length scenario, where the external friendly jammer UAV will transmit jamming signal to deteriorate the quality of eavesdropping channel, and help to improve the secure communication performance of the source UAV. Specifically, an average effective secrecy rate (AESR) maximization problem is formulated by jointly designing the trajectories and transmit power of the source/jammer UAV subject to the UAVs’ mobility constraints and power constraints. It is also verified that there exists a unique optimal packet error rate to maximize the AESR. The formulated problem is mathematically intractable, as it is nonconvex and involves coupled optimization variables. Therefore, we first decompose the trajectories and power optimization problem into four non-convex subproblems, and then transform them into standard convex problems by applying first-order Taylor expansion. Then, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm for AESR problem based on Bisection method and successive convex approximation (SCA) technology is presented by addressing the five subproblems iteratively. Simulation results are provided to verify that our proposed scheme can obtain considerable better AESR gain compared to other four benchmark schemes. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - Although unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay can provide auxiliary communication due to its flexible mobility, it is vulnerable to jamming attacks. This paper considers the UAV relay anti-jamming communication issue under the threat of a malicious jammer with beam-forming jamming capability. To prevent the relay link from deteriorating, UAV trajectory adjustment and transmission mode switching between half-duplex and full-duplex are two available schemes, while they will incur the additional flying costs and continuous mode switching, respectively. To balance the trade-off between trajectory optimization and mode selection, this paper investigates the joint trajectory optimization and mode selection anti-jamming approach. First, an anti-jamming utility considering the cost-efficient and end-to-end capacity gains is designed. Second, to model the bounded rationality of both the UAV relay and the jammer due to the adversarial context, a biased Stackelberg game to analyse the competitive system interactions is proposed. Moreover, the existence of Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) in the problem is proved. Finally, a joint mode selection and trajectory optimization (JMSTO) algorithm based on the multi-armed bandit is proposed to obtain the SE. It is further demonstrated that the JMSTO algorithm has a logarithmic regret. The results show that our proposed JMSTO algorithm is superior to non-joint optimization methods. © 2022 The Authors.

TI  - An optimization-based selection approach of landing sites for swarm unmanned aerial vehicles in unknown environments
AU  - Yang, Linjie
AU  - Wang, Luping
T2  - Expert Systems with Applications
AB  - Autonomous selection of landing sites is an important capability of a mission when unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) face technical difficulties or adverse weather, especially in unknown environments. In order to build a better decision-making system for swarm UAVs landing, besides terrain safety, the global flight cost among individuals should be also considered during descent. However, the existing methods cannot solve these problems elegantly due to terrain uncertainty and optimization complexity. In this paper, we present an optimization method to tackle this issue based on point cloud integrating the coarse-to-fine manner and swarm intelligence model. Specifically, our method starts with a point cloud preprocessing module for sparse elevation estimation and robust path planning. In the coarse stage, a novel cost map is constructed by extracting only low-level features from the elevation map. Based on the optimum results of the coarse selection, the final landing sites are automatically generated and finely evaluated in terms of multiple 3D terrain factors. Finally, the landing model of swarm-UAVs is treated as an unbalanced assignment problem, which minimizes flight costs by incorporating terrain safety, fuel consumption, and path planning. Experimental evaluations on three different real-world scenario datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both normal operations and emergency situations. © 2022

AB  - This paper investigates a dual-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided communication system to improve the security of the communication between ground devices and UAVs. Different from the existing works which ignored ground devices mobility and just considered one-way communication security between ground devices and UAVs, we allow the devices to be mobile and consider bi-directional ground-UAV communication security. Specifically, one UAV server communicates with mobile ground devices, and the other UAV jammer is invoked to confuse eavesdroppers. Our objective is to maximize the worst-case average secrecy rate by the joint optimization of UAV trajectory and sender transmit power. To achieve it, we first formulate the worst-case average secrecy rate maximization problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) under the constraints of UAV flight space, flight speed, energy capacity, anti-collision, and peak transmit power. Then, we design a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) based algorithm to solve the CMDP. Experiment results demonstrate that our joint optimization scheme can enhance the communication security in terms of the secrecy rate in both UAV-to-ground (U2G) case and ground-to-UAV (G2U) case. Besides, it is observed that UAV trajectory and sender transmit power have different impacts on the communication security in U2G case and G2U case. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has emerged as a promising novel application for the Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless communication by leveraging more favorable Line-of-Sight (LoS) propagation. However, the jamming resistance by exploiting UAV's mobility is a new challenge in the UAV-ground communication. This paper investigates the trajectory planning problem in an UAV communication system, where the UAV is operated by a Ground Control Unit (GCU) to perform certain tasks in the presence of multiple jammers with imperfect power and location information. To ensure the reliability of the GCU-to-UAV link, we formulate the problem as a non-convex semi-infinite optimization, aiming to maximize the average worst-case Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) over a given flight duration by designing the robust trajectory of the UAV under stringent energy availability constraints. To handle this problem efficiently, we develop an iterative algorithm for the solution with the aid of S-procedure and Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) method. Numerous results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm and offer some useful design insights to practical system. © 2021 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics

AB  - The need to successfully navigate in the absence of GNSS has grown in recent years. In particular, light aircraft such as UAVs are growing in popularity for a variety of applications vulnerable to GPS denial. The research presented here develops a GPS-denied navigation scheme for light aircraft employing images formed from a synthetic aperture radar system. Past research has explored the utility of radar telemetry in GPS-denied systems. This research advances previous work by exploiting radar images to obtain range and cross-range position measurements. Images are formed using the Range-Doppler Algorithm, an efficient image formation algorithm ideal for the sometimes limited processing packages available to light aircraft. An inertial navigation and radar processing system is implemented using both real and simulated radar images to aid in estimating an aircraft’s state in a GPS-denied environment. The results show that navigation in the absence of GPS using synthetic aperture radar is feasible with converging and bounded estimation errors. © 2022 Institute of Navigation.

AB  - This paper investigates the anti-jamming trajectory design to safeguard the effective data collection, where a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is dispatched to collect data over multiple sensor nodes(SNs) in jamming environment. Under the limited power and transmission range of SNs, we aim to minimize the UAV's flight energy consumption in a finite task period, by jointly optimizing SNs collection sequence and UAV flight trajectory. Firstly, we propose a general optimization framework which consists of path planning and trajectory optimization for the formulated non-convex problem. In the path planning phase, a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is used to provide the initial path of the UAV, which is the shortest path to visit each SN. In the trajectory optimization phase, we introduce the concept of Communication Flight Corridor (CFC) to meet the non-convex constraints and apply a piecewise Bezier curve, based on Bernoulli polynomial, to represent the flight trajectory of the UAV, which can transform the optimization variables from infinite time variables to polynomial coefficients of finite order. Finally, we simulate the flight trajectory of UAV in hovering mode and continuous flight mode under different parameters, and the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2013 China Institute of Communications.

AB  - This article investigates the covert performance of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jammer-assisted cognitive radio (CR) network. In particular, the covert transmission of secondary users can be effectively protected by UAV jamming against the eavesdropping. For practical consideration, the UAV is assumed to only know certain partial channel distribution information (CDI), whereas not to know the detection threshold of an eavesdropper. For this sake, we propose a model-driven generative adversarial network (MD-GAN)-assisted optimization framework, consisting of a generator and a discriminator, where the unknown channel information and the detection threshold are learned weights. Then, a GAN-based joint trajectory and power optimization (GAN-JTP) algorithm is developed to train the MD-GAN optimization framework for covert communication, which results in the joint solution of the UAV's trajectory and transmits power to maximize the covert rate and the probability of detection errors. Our simulation results show that the proposed GAN-JTP with a rapid convergence speed can attain near-optimal solutions of the UAV's trajectory and transmit power for the covert communication. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Quadruped robots, an important class of unmanned aerial vehicles, have broad potential for applications in education, service, industry, military, and other fields. Their independent positioning plays a key role for completing assigned tasks in a complex environment. However, positioning based on global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) may result in GNSS jamming and quadruped robots not operating properly in environments sheltered by buildings. In this paper, a tightly coupled LiDAR vision inertial odometer (LVIO) is proposed to address the positioning inaccuracy of quadruped robots, which have poor mileage information obtained though legs and feet structures only. With this optimization method, the point cloud data obtained by 3D LiDAR, the image feature information obtained by binocular vision, and the IMU inertial data are combined to improve the precise indoor and outdoor positioning of a quadruped robot. This method reduces the errors caused by the uniform motion model in laser odometer as well as the image blur caused by rapid movements of the robot, which can lead to error-matching in a dynamic scene; at the same time, it alleviates the impact of drift on inertial measurements. Finally, the quadruped robot in the laboratory is used to build a physical platform for verification. The experimental results show that the designed LVIO effectively realizes the positioning of four groups of robots with high precision and strong robustness, both indoors or outdoors, which verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2022 by the authors.

TI  - Learning-Based UAV Trajectory Optimization with Collision Avoidance and Connectivity Constraints
AU  - Wang, Xueyuan

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be an integral part of wireless networks, and determining collision-free trajectories for multiple UAVs while satisfying requirements of connectivity with ground base stations (GBSs) is a challenging task. In this paper, we consider non-cooperative multi-UAV scenarios, in which multiple UAVs need to fly from initial locations to destinations, while satisfying collision avoidance, wireless connectivity, and kinematic constraints. We aim to find trajectories for the UAVs with the goal to minimize their mission completion time. We first formulate the multi-UAV trajectory optimization problem as a sequential decision making problem. We, then, propose a decentralized deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the problem. More specifically, a value network is developed to obtain values given the agent's joint state (including the agent's information, the nearby agents' observable information, and the locations of the nearby GBSs). A signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-prediction neural network is also designed, using accumulated SINR measurements obtained when interacting with the cellular network, to map the GBSs' locations into the SINR levels in order to predict the UAV's SINR. Numerical results show that with the value network and SINR-prediction network, real-time navigation for multi-UAVs can be efficiently performed in various environments with high success rate. © 2022 IEEE.

TI  - A Robust Navigation Solution to Enable Safe Autonomous Aerospace Operations
AU  - Purisai, Sri

T2  - SAE Technical Papers
AB  - The world is seeing a rise in demand for UAVs due to their versatile applications and aptness for widespread use. GPS signal is a critical input for safe and accurate navigation of UAS/UAV. It is now being globally recognized that The GPS (Global Positioning System) is susceptible to jamming and can be suppressed or lost when in urban canyons and dense metro locations. Jamming can be easily initiated using cheap jammers sold online and easily accessible. For both defense and commercial enterprise applications, GPS jamming continues to be a GAP and a barrier to FULL BVLOS autonomous drone operations. With an increasing number of UAV users relying on precise location services to carry out their everyday tasks, public safety and the country's defense positions (especially at border regions) would be jeopardized if the GPS was to be interfered with or even shut down intentionally or accidentally. As a result, in addition to safeguarding the system against unauthorized usage, it is critical to assure signal consistency at all times. Several standard bodies such as the SAE and ANSI standards have already documented the GAP and have begun to identify solutions to address the gap. Anti-jamming technologies are now being required in UAS and UAM systems in several US and international countries. Honeywell and infiniDome have jointly developed a "Robust Navigation System"that provides a multilayer resiliency against loss of GPS. This system is being utilized by several tier 1 UAS manufacturers and defense suppliers. We STRONGLY ENCOURAGE the Indian government evaluate and mandate measures for GPS jam-proofing in their present and future systems to enable safe operations of UAS/UAV in defense and civilian applications. Below we provide a few use cases and how a Robust Navigation System will provide safety and resiliency in operations. © 2022 SAE International. All Rights Reserved.

Different from existing works, we consider the dynamic deployment of IRS-UAV in the environment of the mobile user and unknown jammer. Therefore, a joint trajectory and passive beamforming optimization approach is proposed in the IRS-UAV enhanced networks. In detail, the optimization problem is firstly formulated into a Markov decision process (MDP). Then, a dueling double deep Q networks multi-step learning algorithm is proposed to tackle the complex and coupling decision-making problem. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the anti-jamming communication performance of the mobile user. © 2013 China Institute of Communications.

AB  - Satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have been introduced as enhanced approaches to provide dynamic control, massive connections and global coverage for future wireless communication systems. This paper considers a coordinated satellite-UAV communication system, where the UAV performs the environmental reconnaissance task with the assistance of satellites in a hostile jamming environment. To fulfill this task, the UAV needs to realize autonomous trajectory control and upload the collected data to the satellite. With the aid of the uploading data, the satellite builds the environment situation map integrating the beam quality, jamming status, and traffic distribution. Accordingly, we propose a closed-loop anti-jamming dynamic trajectory optimization approach, which is divided into three stages. Firstly, a coarse trajectory planning is made according to the limited prior information and preset points. Secondly, the flight control between two adjacent preset points is formulated as a Markov decision process, and reinforcement learning (RL) based automatic flying control algorithms are proposed to explore the unknown hostile environment and realize autonomous and precise trajectory control. Thirdly, based on the collected data during the UAV's flight, the satellite utilizes an environment situation estimating algorithm to build an environment situation map, which is used to reselect the preset points for the first stage and provide better initialization for the RL process in the second stage. Simulation results verify the validity and superiority of the proposed approach. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

AB  - We investigate a transmission mechanism aiming to improve the data rate between a base station (BS) and a user equipment (UE) through deploying multiple relaying UAVs. We consider the effect of interference incurred by another established communication network, which makes our problem challenging and different from the state of the art. We aim to design the 3D trajectories and power allocation for the UAVs to maximize the data flow of the network while keeping the interference on the existing communication network below a threshold. We utilize the mobility feature of the UAVs to evade the (un)-intended interference caused by (un)-intentional interferers. To this end, we propose an alternating-maximization approach to jointly obtain the 3D trajectories and the UAVs transmission powers. We handle the 3D trajectory design by resorting to spectral graph theory and subsequently address the power allocation through convex optimization techniques. We also approach the problem from the intentional interferer's perspective where smart jammers chase the UAVs to effectively degrade the data flow of the network. We also extend our work to the case for multiple UEs. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method through extensive simulations. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - With the maneuverability and mobility control of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), carrying mobile edge computing (MEC) servers on UAVs is able to effectively alleviate the explosive growth of data traffic pressure. However, UAV adopts line-of-sight transmission which has broadcasting characteristics. Malicious eavesdroppers can easily take advantage of the characteristics to eavesdrop information during the UAV edge computing. Therefore, the security of the UAV-MEC systems is a challenging problem. This article proposes a secure communication scheme for the dual-UAV-MEC system. In the proposed scheme, UAV server assists ground users in calculating the offloading tasks. In order to reduce the eavesdropping of offloading information by UAV eavesdropper, jammer sends interference signals on the ground. We aim to maximize the user's minimum secure calculation capacity by optimizing resources and trajectory of the UAV server. We first transform the optimization problem into a tractable form through mathematical methods and use successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent algorithms to solve it in an iterative manner. The final numerical results show that, compared with the benchmark schemes, the method proposed in this article effectively increases the secure calculation capacity of the system. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

T2  - IEEE Internet of Things Journal
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are anticipated to be a potential data collection solution for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The main challenges of integrating UAVs in WSNs are security threats and UAV's onboard energy limitation. To cope with these two challenges, this article examines the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problem in UAV-enabled WSN. Specifically, a full-duplex (FD) UAV gathers confidential information from ground sensor nodes (SNs) in the uplink while sending jamming signals to confound a ground eavesdropper (Eve) in the downlink. Considering a passive eavesdropping scenario lacking Eve's instantaneous channel state information (CSI), the resulting problem is subject to the constraints of connection outage probability (COP), secrecy outage probability (SOP), securely collected bits, and flight trajectory. To tackle the intractable nonconvex problem, we first derive the optimal codeword rate and redundancy rate in closed-form expressions and then develop a low-complexity algorithm using the block coordinate descent (BCD) approach to alternatively optimize the SN scheduling, SN transmit power, UAV transmit power, and UAV trajectory. Simulation results verify the performance gains of the proposed scheme compared with the benchmark schemes. In particular, the proposed scheme achieves nearly the same secrecy rate gains at a lower UAV's energy consumption cost than the sum secrecy rate maximization (SSRM) baseline. Moreover, it is revealed that trajectory optimization of the proposed scheme plays a crucial role in improving SEE performance compared with the circle trajectory (CT) baseline. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - This paper studies a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled wireless communication system, where multiple UAVs are employed to communicate with a group of ground terminals (GTs) in the presence of potential jammers. We aim to maximize the throughput overall GTs by jointly optimizing the UAVs' trajectory, the GTs' scheduling and power allocation. Unlike most prior studies, we consider the UAVs' turning and climbing angle constraints, the UAVs' three-dimensional (3D) trajectory constraints, minimum UAV-to-UAV (U2U) distance constraint, and the GTs' transmit power requirements. However, the formulated problem is a mixed-integer non-convex problem and is intractable to work it out with conventional optimization methods. To tackle this difficulty, we propose an efficient robust iterative algorithm to decompose the original problem be three sub-problems and acquire the suboptimal solution via utilizing the block coordinate descent (BCD) method, successive convex approximation (SCA) technique, and S-procedure. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed robust iterative algorithm offers a substantial gain in the system performance compared with the benchmark algorithms. © 2013 China Institute of Communications.

T2  - Drones
AB  - Applications of drones have increased significantly in the past decade for both indoor and outdoor operations. In order to assist autonomous drone navigation, there are numerous sensors installed onboard the vehicles. These include Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) chipsets, inertial sensors, barometer, lidar, radar and vision sensors. The two sensors used most often by drone autopilot controllers for absolute positioning are the GNSS chipsets and barometer. Although, for most outdoor operations, these sensors provide accurate and reliable position information, their accuracy, availability, and integrity deteriorate for indoor applications and in the presence of radio frequency interference (RFI), such as GNSS spoofing and jamming. Therefore, it is possible to derive network-based locations from Wi-Fi and cellular transmission. Although there have been many theoretical studies on network positioning, limited resources are available for the expected quantitative performance of these positioning methodologies. In this paper, the authors investigate both the horizontal and vertical accuracy of the Android network location engines under rural, suburban, and urban environments. The paper determines the horizontal location accuracy to be approximately 1637 m, 38 m, and 32 m in terms of 68% circular error probable (CEP) for rural, suburban, and urban environments, respectively, and the vertical accuracy to be 1.2 m and 4.6 m in terms of 68% CEP for suburban and urban environments, respectively. In addition, the availability and latency of the location engines are explored. Furthermore, the paper assesses the accuracy of the Android network location accuracy indicator for various drone operation environments. The assessed accuracies of the network locations provide a deeper insight into their potential for drone navigation. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications are vulnerable to smart attacks, where the attacker can change the attack mode (e.g., eavesdropping and jamming) via smart radio devices. To ensure secure transmissions against hybrid attacks, UAVs may transmit confidential information and misleading information alternately. In this paper, we consider a dynamic anti-hybrid attack framework with trajectory optimization, where both a UAV and an attacker attempt to find their optimal trajectories without knowing the information type and the attack mode of each other. Given the major challenge due to incomplete knowledge (i.e., each agent knows only its own information), we establish an adversarial game with partial-observation feature to formulate an optimization problem, and propose a counterfactual regret minimization learning scheme to achieve the correlated equilibrium for both the UAV and attacker. Simulation results validate the superiority of our scheme over a benchmark in UAV communication scenarios with partial information. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The simulation computer is the main body of the system, and the hardware and software of the system are designed on the basis of considering the two functional requirements of integrated UAV interception and counter-simulation. Firstly, the voices of unmanned aerial vehicles, birds and people within 100 m are collected, preprocessed and extracted with MFCC+GFCC eigenvalues, and their eigenvalues are used as data sets for learning and recognition by convolutional neural networks. Then, the interception model of UAV route planning based on convolutional neural network algorithm and the corresponding deception jamming counter-measure model are expounded. The model effect is simulated and evaluated by computer, and the convergence speed of the algorithm is discussed. The power and optimal deployment position and number of jammers are simulated under the condition that no base station is intercepted in 50 interception routes, thus proving the availability and accuracy of the jammer position planning model. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - In the modern world, radar systems are being used in various fields. Among those fields are radio monitoring, radio navigation, electronic warfare, organizing of rescue operations during disasters, movement of animals in the wildlife, protection of private territories, etc. In this work we discuss and propose a development and production of a system for radio direction finding within the framework of the protection from civil and special purpose UAVs. As a result of the implementation of this algorithm, it would be possible to obtain information about UAVs with radio emission. By receiving the radio emissions, it would be possible to keep under control those movements. Particularly, if necessary, by additional measurements, it would be possible to implement local radio protection, thus preventing those movements. Note that suggested system would be controlled remotely, which is an advantage in some special cases. This system could be used in other applications where radio detection and direction finding is necessary. © IET Conference Proceedings 2022.

AB  - Flight safety is compromised when positioning with Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is rendered unusable or unreliable. The cause of such GNSS-denied situations can be signal obstruction, multipath issues from mountains or tall buildings as well as malicious jamming or spoofing. The Swedish company Spacemetric is working together with the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm to address the challenge of accurate and reliable aerial localisation, which is a key aspect to ensure flight safety for autonomous aerial navigation. The project, called “Autonomous Navigation Support from Real-Time Visual Mapping”, focusses on vision-based methods for aerial positioning in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles navigating in natural environments. This paper present results from the project's ongoing research on vision-based approaches with deep learning as well as a novel approach to localisation which exploits the three-dimensional structure of vegetation and terrain. © 2022 ICAS.

AB  - The recent advent of computational intelligence and the field of deep learning has shown a significant application for the task of efficient navigation of automated and unmanned vehicles. The notion of a robot intelligently deciding a path based on minimalistic spatial knowledge and operating in a collision-free manner illustrates significant real-world importance. This paper offers a novel study for determining the best strategy for robust path planning in a simulated environment sufficed with static obstacles. The paradigm of behavior cloning and imitation learning is extensively explored, these techniques have depicted a better analogy to the human brain hence, justifying the experiments. This paper also conducts extensive tests on the existing technologies as baselines for an unbiased comparison, these algorithms include Rapidly- exploring Random Tree (RRT), A* search algorithm, and an improved rendition of the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The algorithms developed are centric to Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) however a correlation is also shown to unmanned ground systems and other automated robotics. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AU  - Ma, Ruyu

AB  - This paper presents a mechanically rotating antenna used in direction-finding (DF) systems on quadcopter unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). UAVs equipped with radio DF systems are widely used in communication, navigation and electronic warfare area among others. However, the DF systems usually require a pair of antennas or more, tending to make them bulky and heavy for smaller UAVs. To alleviate this issue, we propose a single-element DF antenna which can employ the rotating propellers of the UAV to steer its radiation pattern. Simulation and numerical experiment results demonstrate that this antenna can achieve direction of arrival estimation accuracy that is similar to conventional mechanically-rotating dipoles without putting additional moving parts on the UAV. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The main problem in the military and commercial sector is to detect the UAV and carry out a successful attack to neutralize it. In this case, sets of various tools from electronic warfare to missile systems can be used for destruction. Small, lightweight UAVs can be shot down with small arms, man-portable EW jamming, or rocket/cannon weapons, requiring more ammunition, limited energy, or high projectile costs. The most pressing issue is the definition of a tool that has intelligent computer control systems, sufficient technical characteristics, is mobile, easy to operate and economically feasible for use in the destruction of low-cost UAVs with a high coefficient of harm. This article discusses the economic and technical feasibility of using a UAV-controlled interceptor using the parallel approach guidance method. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Formal modeling techniques can be exploited for autonomous vehicle modeling, enabling resilient navigation inside container terminals (CTs). Road vehicles will be characterized by a new intelligent vehicle technology such as Intelligent Autonomous vehicle (IAV) compared to the trucks, which are able to bring containers within the Terminal Container (TC) based on GPS. In the TC, electric unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present in the TC are able to emulate redundant positioning data from the IAV, where its signals are disturbed within the corridor of containers. Petri nets are formal models suitable for modeling and controlling classes of systems such as transportation systems. They allow to control the movement of the IAV while reconstructing the positioning data of the IAV. This is ensured by GPS or by communication between the IAV that loses its position and the IAV s close to it, the other drones, and the crane. Thus, this paper proposes a reconfiguration strategy for the IAV to manage its navigation under resilient conditions, even if it loses its own GPS signal. Simulation results and perspectives are presented in this paper. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Due to the broadcast feature of the wireless channels, users are easily eavesdropped by eavesdroppers during data transmission, resulting in data leakage. To ensure the Device-to-device (D2D) communications security, in this paper, we propose a UAV-assisted secure communication system where a mobile UAV can transmit the jamming signal to counter the ground eavesdropper to enhance the security of communication. We develop a connection outage probability model to ensure the continuous communication and derive the closed form expression of the connection outage probability for D2D users. We formulated a secrecy rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing UAV's trajectory and jamming power, in which, the secrecy rate is defined as the difference between the transmission rate and the eavesdropping rate. To solve it, we propose a TD3-based algorithm to optimize the UAV's trajectory and jamming power. Simulation results illustrate that the overall average secrecy rate of D2D users achieved by our proposed algorithm outperforms other baselines. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - This paper studies the trade-off between the comunication capacity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the UAV's unintentional interference in a shared spectrum scenario. In fact, UAV will also cause unintentional interference to other ground users (GUs) who do not communicate with the UAV while transmitting data to a specific ground node (GN). And the location of these GUs is usually unknown. For this problem, we introduce the concept of unacceptable area in which the interference power received by GUs from UAV exceeds their anti-jamming tolerance, and study the trade-off between UAV's average communication capacity and average unacceptable area by joint UAV's 3D trajectory and transmit power optimization. Further, we propose an effective iterative algorithm to solve this non-convex problem by using successive convex approximation (SCA) and block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Numerical results show the proposed scheme can meet the communication requirements of UAV and reduce the UAV's unintentional interference at the same time. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are vulnerable to a number of threats, including jamming. Jamming is the act of intentionally directing electromagnetic energy towards a communication and / or navigation system to disrupt or prevent signal transmission and reception. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) jammers transmit interference signals in the frequency band used for satellite navigation. Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) filter as a potential solution to mitigate the jamming activity. The effectiveness of FSS depends on the incidence angle of the jamming signals. It is important to characterize the GPS performance of the UAV in the absence of the FSS filter, which will be used as a benchmark for modelling the appropriate FSS filter. Hence, this paper aims to investigate preliminary effects of jamming signal on UAV. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming on UAVs based on two different conditions, namely, varying times and rotation angles. The study was conducted using GPS simulation in an anechoic chamber to prevent external interferences and multipath. Different estimated probable error (EPE) patterns are observed at different times due to the GPS satellite constellation being dynamic. This indicates that GPS accuracy is time-dependent. The results also show that the presence of a jammer imposes a significant effect on GPS accuracy when the jammer signal reaches -89 dBm. The significance of this work is to provide a solution to prevent GPS jamming and ensure safe and reliable UAV navigation by using a frequency selective surface (FSS) filter for future work. © 2022 IEEE.

Firstly, establish the interaction rules and the swarm aggregation control model. Furthermore, considering different initial states of them, the target guidance control model is designed from the normal and tangential directions respectively. Finally, combining with the swarm aggregation and the target tendency, the proposed strategy is verified by simulation studies. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - With the rapid development of UAV control link and ad hoc network, and the low success rate of single UAV mission, a large number of UAVs have become the mainstream in disaster relief, security and other fields. In the airport, the interference and Countermeasure of the competition venue against UAVs has become the core link of security in large-scale events and important places. The existing interference sources are mainly single point interference. Due to the shielding of buildings, it is impossible to fully cover the venue. Therefore, distributed interference optimization is the best option to combat large-scale UAVs in the future. On the basis of summarizing the jamming benefit evaluation system, this paper introduces the probability of jamming source discovery as the jamming cost, and establishes the satellite navigation distributed jamming optimization model. Tabu search artificial bee colony algorithm (TSABC) is proposed to solve the problems of slow interference speed and low success rate of traditional distributed interference optimization algorithm. The algorithm proposed in this paper is compared with ABC algorithm and PSO algorithm in interference countermeasure scenario. The simulation results show that the TSABC algorithm proposed in this paper effectively improves the interference efficiency and can quickly and accurately interfere with a large number of UAVs. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Waypoints have enhanced the prospect of fully autonomous drone applications. However, Geographical Position System (GPS) spoofing and signal interferences are key issues in waypoint-based drone applications. Also, conceptual waypoint-based drone applications require accurate awareness of waypoints based on environmental cues and integration of additional sensing modalities. Additional sensor modalities may overwhelm drones' processing resources, reducing operational time. This study proposes W-MobileNet, a denoising model for autonomous trajectory trail navigation based on precision control of a path planner, denoising capabilities of Weiner filters, and perceptual knowledge of convolutional neural networks. Creatively integrating the modules of W-MobileNet results in an intuitive drone navigation controller characterized by position, orientation, and speed estimation. Further, a generic loss function that significantly aids models to converge faster during training is proposed based on adaptive weights. An extensive evaluation of a simulated and real-world experiment shows that W-MobileNet is more favorable in precision and robustness than contemporary state-of-the-art models. W-MobileNet has the potential to become one of the standards for autonomous drone applications. © 2022 - IOS Press.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained a lot of attention due to their applications in various sectors. Most of fully autonomous UAVs navigation system is dependent on GNSS for localization. But the security threats that emanates from GPS system; spoofing and jamming makes the reliance on GNSS problematic. In this work, we proposed a fully autonomous UAV navigation system without GNSS and wireless communication. The application area of interest in this work is military battlefield. The proposed navigation method combines information gathered by Intelligence Preparation for Battlefield (IPB) and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance(ISR) group and onboard sensors. Then it applies AI-enabled multi sensor fusion, motion planning and decision making to accomplish the navigation successfully. The integrated way of navigation used to assess the conceptual possibility of autonomous navigation without the use of external navigation system and reliable operation of UAV at GPS and wireless signal denied environment. In addition, to ensure reliable operation of the navigation system, devices health monitoring system through the use of distributed monitoring agent and AI algorithms are proposed. The conceptual architecture is designed as six layer architecture with cross-layer interaction feature. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly becoming a challenge for both civilian and military security. Even simple modifications of these inexpensive and widely available systems can create a serious threat which potentially causes major damage. Using signals from global navigation satellite system (GNSS), UAVs are able to operate over long distances and to find their target zone without remote control of a pilot. In this flight mode, radio direction finder cannot detect any transmitted signal. Typical countermeasures like RF jamming or Wi-Fi hacking become ineffective to stop the threat. The DLR smart GPS spoofing approach is a promising technology for a cost-effective countermeasure against such autonomously flying Micro UAVs. Several dedicated devices must reliably interact to fulfil this task. The optical identification and position measurement of the UAVs was developed at the DLR Institute of Technical Physics. By optimizing the tracking processes and the laser ranging systems, even small and agile targets can be tracked. The measured position and flight data are forwarded to a GPS spoofing system developed by the DLR Institute of Communications and Navigation. The emitted GPS signal is modified in such a way that the UAV leaves its original flight trajectory and is redirected to a save one. Outside the protected area the UAV can be forced to ground without collateral damages. The feedback loop via the independent optical position measurement ensures that the desired flight trajectory is maintained. The basic functionalities of the smart GPS spoofing countermeasure were successfully demonstrated in realistic field tests. The optical setup and first results will be discussed. © 2022 SPIE.

AU  - Ren, Yan

AB  - Almost all military systems and combat platforms rely on GNSS to achieve military missions. However, they are facing more and more intensive jamming and spoofing attacks. Due to the rapid development of computer vision technology and vision sensor, visual navigation and localization technology have gradually revealed their advantages to solve this kind of problem. In this paper, a new framework of visual localization under a GNSS-denied environment is proposed. Firstly, a novel image preprocessing method based on information entropy and granular segmentation is presented which can significantly filtrate the Google tiles in the georeferenced area to parsimony set to reduce UAV localization time. Secondly, we introduce an end-to-end image matching method based on convolutional neural network and image preprocessing to realize UAV localization which has strong robustness and localization accuracy. Finally, the proposed localization algorithm achieves experimental performance on the real images captured by DJI Phantom 3 drone. The good accuracy and fast execution time shown by experiments indicate that the proposed localization algorithm can serve as a powerful tool to keep the UAVs working continuously in the face of intensive jamming and spoofing attacks. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - With the maturity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, UAV plays an important role in communication due to its high mobility. In this paper, we study a dual-UAVs assisted communication system to combat both UAV eavesdropper and multiple eavesdroppers on the ground. Our goal is to maximize the minimum average secrecy rate among all ground users by jointly optimizing the UAV basestation trajectory, auxiliary interference UAV trajectory, transmit power control and user scheduling. To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and block coordinate descent (BCD) to make the problem approximate convex. Specifically, we consider a more complex scene with eavesdroppers on the ground and in the air, and we adapt the Rician fading channel model with small scale fading and large scale fading for air-to-ground communication, and the free space fading model for air-to-air communication. Compared with the single fading channel model, a more realistic situation is presented. The simulation results show joint design of dual-UAVs can significantly improve the average secrecy rate compared with the single UAV-Aided scheme, and when only ideal line of sight (LoS) fading is considered, the secrecy rate is slightly higher than our proposed scheme. However, if the trajectory of the UAVs considering only LoS is put into our proposed model, the result will be slightly lower than our proposed algorithm. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The paper presents an architecture design of a custom drone whose mission consists in reproducing typical cinematographic shots in unstructured environments, where loss or degradation of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal can be experienced due to jamming, spoofing, and multipath effects. In this application field, an accurate measurement system is required to estimate the drone position and attitude with a high-Accuracy level; in fact, not only do these values have a remarkable impact on the execution of the cinematographic shots, but they also allow to adopt drones in critical environmental conditions such as tunnels, bridges, canyon, and desert which are typical for these applications. The preliminary configuration is designed considering Unmanned Vehicle's navigation and communication requirements; in particular, the paper proposes the integration of a tactical-grade Inertial Navigation Unit (IMU) and an accurate GNSS receiver in RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) mode, and the employment of a 5G Radio-modem to compensate for any signal loss or damage. In addition, an appropriate hardware selection algorithm is proposed to also account for power consumption due to 5G and GNSS module usage depending on the mission type and on the GNSS integrity signal. The employment of 5G technology is then proposed as an advantageous solution in case of GNSS signal loss or damage and, finally, a suitable GNSS/5G integrated methodology is assessed. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Dedicated and aerial fifth generation (5G) networks, here called 5G overlay networks, are envisaged to enhance existing positioning services, when combined with global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and other sensors. There is a need for accurate and timely positioning in safety-critical automotive and aerial applications, such as advanced warning systems or in urban air mobility (UAM). Today, these high-accuracy demands can partially be satisfied by GNSS, though not in dense urban conditions or under GNSS threats (e.g. interference, jamming or spoofing). Temporary and on-demand 5G network deployments using ground and flying base stations (BSs) are indeed a novel solution to exploit hybrid GNSS, 5G and sensor algorithms for the provision of accurate three-dimensional (3D) position and motion information, especially for challenging urban and suburban scenarios. Thus, this paper first analyzes the positioning technologies available, including signals, positioning methods, algorithms and architectures. Then, design considerations of 5G overlay networks are discussed, by including simulation results on the 5G signal bandwidth, antenna array and network deployment. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Vapor loss and molecular absorption make the transmission distance in sub-Terahertz bands a challenge, especially in mobile statues such as UAVs communication. The molecular absorption element is an essential part of the path loss in THz communication channel modeling that cannot be neglected. Along this direction, we investigated the UAV trajectories in sub-THz band. To maximize the secrecy rate of the UAVs communication, an optimization problem has been proposed to jointly optimize the trajectory and transmit power. To enhance the obtained average secrecy rate, MIMO communication and a cooperative UAV jammer strategy were used in this paper. Also, analysis and simulations results were presented to show the performance of UAV-ground communication at THz communications. Finally, Secrecy Outage Probability was obtained for each UAV trajectories in different flight periods to examine the performance of physical layer security added to the UAV-ground communication at sub-THz communication. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate jamming-resilient unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning strategies for data collection in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, in which the typical UAV can learn the optimal trajectory to elude such jamming attacks. Specifically, the typical UAV is required to collect data from multiple distributed IoT nodes under collision avoidance, mission completion deadline, and kinematic constraints in the presence of jamming attacks. We first design an intelligent UAV jammer, which utilizes reinforcement learning to choose actions based on its observation. Then, an intelligent UAV anti-jamming strategy is constructed to deal with such attacks, and the optimal trajectory of the typical UAV is obtained via dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN). Simulation results show that the intelligent jamming attack has great influence on the UAV's performance, and the proposed defense strategy can recover the performance close to that in no-jammer scenarios. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Due to the recent technological development in drone technology, a drone is used in many applications like delivery, search and rescue, and safety inspection especially in low altitude airspace. However, the mass deployment of drones for commercial purposes is yet to be matured. Therefore, normally drone is used in time-critical applications like the delivery of essential medical supplies, these applications often require high reliability. Nowadays, drone normally relies on Global Positioning System (GPS) alone for outdoor navigation, but there is also the possibility that the GPS signal is lost due to GPS jamming in the area. This paper provides a solution for drone navigation in an unknown outdoor environment with no GPS signal. The drone’s surrounding environment is perceived via a camera and is constructed into a 3D occupancy grid map, followed by localization of its position. The navigation is formulated as a sequential decision-making problem and modeled using a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). The simulation shows the drone can navigate towards the goal by taking a local optimum decision iteratively based on its perceived surrounding environment at each step. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

AB  - This work addresses the issue of the modeling of a system of systems of autonomous road and aerial vehicles, allowing making a resilient navigation inside Container Terminals (CT). The road vehicles are characterized by Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles (IAV), able to transport containers inside the terminal based on Global Signal Positioning (GPS). The Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are present in the CT, emulating a redundant positioning data of the IAV, where its navigational signals are disturbed inside corridor of stacked containers inside the CT. In this framework, we propose a high-level Petri net model, allowing to control the IAV movement while reconstructing the positioning data of the IAV, due to the communication between the IAV and the UAV. Studied as an SoS, this work addresses the IAV reconfiguration in resilient condition, as a mode management problem. The aspects of mode activation/deactivation, starting state and handling of resource states common to multiple operating modes are taken into account in the proposed model. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - This paper aims at applying polarized skylight navigation to the actual small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide a new method for UAVs in electromagnetic interference environment. Firstly, we adopt an angle conversion algorithm between polarization sensors output and the yaw angle. Then, tilt correction algorithm is designed to solve the problem that yaw angle error increases when the UAVs tilts. And then, we proposed an integrated navigation system of a polarization sensor, a micro inertial measurement unit (MIMU) and a global positioning system (GPS) to obtain the complete navigation parameters for UAVs. Finally, we apply the algorithm to a small quadrotor UAV, and control the UAV to perform autonomous mission in the electromagnetic interference environment. The experimental results show that the proposed method has higher yaw angle accuracy, strong anti-interference ability and no cumulative error which can meet the accuracy and reliability requirements of small UAVs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

TI  - Strategies for Jamming in Discrete Frequency Subbands-Characteristics and Main Applications
AU  - Lebl, Aleksandar

AB  - The progress in applied techniques to cause more human victims and material damage is obvious every day. Two of such sources are remote controlled improvised explosive devices and drones for malicious purposes. The frequencies and message bit rates for necessary signals transmission of such devices are continually increasing thus leading to efficiency decrease of classical jamming techniques, especially pure sweep jamming. In this paper we analyze comb jamming and sweep jamming with discrete subbands as two techniques to overcome this problem. IRI℡ is one of the pioneers in the world in the implementation of both strategies. In the first case several discrete frequency components are swept in the same time and thus the sweep rate is effectively increased. The second technique is well suited to be implemented when signal frequencies and signal levels to be jammed are a priori known. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - The communications quality of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been brought into focus increasingly, which can be severely affected by other users, as well as complex topography. In this letter, we propose a path planning algorithm for UAV anti-jamming communications with the joint assistance of two kinds of radio maps - signal power map and signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) map, which contain the abundant information of path loss caused by the topography and interference from jammers. We show how to generate these maps from real topographic data, and provide the optimal UAV path planning by adopting the power and the SNR maps to the heuristic and graphic based A∗ algorithm. Simulations with various settings for areas with complex topography in real world, show that the proposed algorithm can considerably improve the efficiency by minimizing the UAV flying distance for anti-jamming communications. © 1994-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) can provide power and information synchronously, which assists to solve the problem of the limited battery capacity and inconvenient charging of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this paper, we investigate a SWIPT system assisted by UAV in jamming environment, where the UAV can transfer power to nodes and nodes can collect energy from the UAV. In order to maximize the minimum throughput among all IoTDs, we jointly optimize the transmit power of IoTDs and the trajectory of UAV during a fix period, while ensuring the lowest energy requirement of each node and avoiding jamming. However, the problem we proposed is NP-hard and difficult to be settled efficiently by existing methods. To address the intractable problem, we develop an iterative algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach. Simulation results indicate that our joint optimization can improve the minimum throughput greatly. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Limited navigation capabilities of many current robots and UAVs restricts their applications in GPS denied areas. Large aircraft with complex navigation systems rely on a variety of sensors including radio frequency aids and high performance inertial systems rendering them somewhat resistant to GPS denial. The rapid development of computer vision has seen cameras incorporated into small drones. Vision-based systems, consisting of one or more cameras, could arguably satisfy both size and weight constraints faced by UAVs. A new generation of thermal sensors is available that are lighter, smaller and widely available. Thermal sensors are a solution to enable navigation in difficult environments, including in low-light, dust or smoke. The purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive literature review of thermal sensors integrated into navigation systems. Furthermore, the physics and characteristics of thermal sensors will also be presented to provide insight into challenges when integrating thermal sensors in place of conventional visual spectrum sensors. ©: © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In this letter, we investigate the UAV swarm communication in the presence of jammers, where cluster-based network architecture is adopted to enable efficient backhaul links. We aim to maximize the sum rate of the cluster head (CH) UAV by optimizing UAVs' trajectories and clustering jointly subject to UAV's various flying abilities. However, the formulated problem is non-convex and thus intractable to solve. Thus, based on block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithm for jointly designing the trajectory and clustering. Moreover, it also shows that the fixed-wing UAV is more favorable in anti-jamming UAV swarm communications, giving a certain practical significance. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Modern unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), including combat drones, are usually equipped with cameras for imaging. A camera is mainly used to increase the accuracy of the attack by ensuring stable-guided flight toward the target when the UAV detects the target in the terminal phase. Despite the high cost of these pieces of equipment, their utilization is in fact low, except during the final stage. The method proposed here extends the range of use of a UAV-mounted camera to the navigation stage. When GPS is unable to estimate the position due to jamming or a sensor error, the possibility of using the position estimation value calculated through vision navigation is described. © 2021, The Korean Society for Aeronautical & Space Sciences.

AB  - Altitude estimation is one of the fundamental tasks of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) automatic navigation, where it aims to accurately and robustly estimate the relative altitude between the UAV and specific areas. However, most methods rely on auxiliary signal reception or expensive equipment, which are not always available, or applicable owing to signal interference, cost or power-consuming limitations in real application scenarios. In addition, fixed-wing UAVs have more complex kinematic models than vertical take-off and landing UAVs. Therefore, an altitude estimation method which can be robustly applied in a GPS denied environment for fixed-wing UAVs must be considered. In this paper, we present a method for high-precision altitude estimation that combines the vision information from a monocular camera and poses information from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) through a novel end-to-end deep neural network architecture. Our method has numerous advantages over existing approaches. First, we utilize the visual-inertial information and physics-based reasoning to build an ideal altitude model that provides general applicability and data efficiency for neural network learning. A further advantage is that we have designed a novel feature fusion module to simplify the tedious manual calibration and synchronization of the camera and IMU, which are required for the standard visual or visual-inertial methods to obtain the data association for altitude estimation modeling. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated, and validated using real flight data obtained during a fixed-wing UAV landing phase. The results show the average estimation error of our method is less than 3% of the actual altitude, which vastly improves the altitude estimation accuracy compared to other visual and visual-inertial based methods. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Now a days, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been exploited in numerous civil and military aspects such as disaster management and border monitoring. Although most of these UAVs are equipped with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) / Inertial Navigation System (INS) reliable integrated system for localization proposes, they are susceptible to lose their GNSS signals under some environmental and artificial challenging circumstances such as, flying in urban areas, jamming, and spoofing. In such complicated scenarios, the navigation solution will degrade rapidly due to the accumulated INS drift errors. Although various aiding sensors such as cameras, and radar are employed to mitigate the INS drift errors, their estimated positioning accuracy is still affected by some factors. This paper presents a nested optimal filter approach (G-H filter, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)) for UAVs in GNSS denied environment, to enhance the estimated positioning accuracy by integrating the Radar Odometry (RO)/INS/MAG to sustain a reliable navigation solution during GNSS outage. First, the UAV relative velocity is calculated based on image processing approach from the radar range doppler map, then the G-H filter is deployed to improve the accuracy of the vehicle estimated forward velocities based on the vehicle dynamic characteristics to reduce the effect of unrealistic velocity estimate from the radar. These improved velocities are then fused with the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), magnetometer, and barometer via EKF to mitigate the positioning RMS errors during the GNSS signals outages. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed system's ability to notably enhance the 3D positioning accuracy during the GNSS signal outage by more than 99% when compared to a stand-alone IMU dead reckoning solution. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - With global coverage, high accuracy, and lightweight receivers, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has been the major positioning solution for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). However, GNSS is prone to electromagnetic interference and malicious attacks such as jamming or spoofing due to its low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To ensure the continuity and safety of UAV operation, the use of redundant navigation systems is crucial. Phased array radio system (PARS) has proven its potential as a local navigation solution in the last few years. PARS is robust against malicious attacks due to a significantly higher SNR than GNSS together with directional and encrypted transmission. One of the challenges of the PARS-based navigation is the radio antenna at ground station, as its orientation needs to be determined precisely to obtain accurate navigation solution for unmanned vehicles. This paper presents an automatic calibration algorithm for the ground radio antenna orientation using a multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF) based on GNSS and PARS measurements. The calibration algorithm was tested with data obtained from a field test using a fixed wing UAV and validated by a residual analysis comparing the PARS- and GNSS-based positioning. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - This paper proposes a mobile unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jamming scheme under the probabilistic line-ofsight channel model (PLCM) to improve the secrecy of ground wiretap channels, in which a friendly UAV is deployed to cooperatively transmit jamming signals to confuse the suspicious eavesdropper. Our goal is to maximize the average (expected) secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the source transmit power, UAV jamming power and trajectory for a given flight time. Since the expected secrecy rate is highly complicated with respect to the UAV trajectory, we derive a more tractable lower bound for it. Nevertheless, the resulting optimization problem remains a non-convex problem, which is difficult to solve optimally. Therefore, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution to it by applying the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results show that the joint power and trajectory optimization scheme under the PLCM significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes. © 2021 IEEE.

AU  - Wang, Xueyuan

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be an integral part of wireless networks, and determining collision-free trajectories for multiple UAVs while satisfying requirements of connectivity with ground base stations (GBSs) is a challenging task. In this paper, we first reformulate the multi-UAV trajectory optimization problem with collision avoidance and wireless connectivity constraints as a sequential decision making problem in the discrete time domain. We, then, propose a decentralized deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the problem. More specifically, a value network is developed to encode the expected time to destination given the agent's joint state (including the agent's information, the nearby agents' observable information, and the locations of the nearby GBSs). An SINR-prediction network is also designed, using accumulated SINR measurements obtained when interacting with the cellular network, to map the GBSs' locations into the SINR levels in order to predict the UAV's SINR. Numerical results show that with the value network and SINR-prediction network, real-time navigation for multi-UAVs can be efficiently performed in various environments with high success rate. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to be an integral part of wireless networks. In this paper, we aim to find collision-free paths for multiple cellular-connected UAVs, while satisfying requirements of connectivity with ground base stations (GBSs) in the presence of a dynamic jammer. We first formulate the problem as a sequential decision making problem in discrete domain, with connectivity, collision avoidance, and kinematic constraints. We, then, propose an offline temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm with online signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) mapping to solve the problem. More specifically, a value network is constructed and trained offline by TD method to encode the interactions among the UAVs and between the UAVs and the environment; and an online SINR mapping deep neural network (DNN) is designed and trained by supervised learning, to encode the influence and changes due to the jammer. Numerical results show that, without any information on the jammer, the proposed algorithm can achieve performance levels close to that of the ideal scenario with the perfect SINR-map. Real-time navigation for multi-UAVs can be efficiently performed with high success rates, and collisions are avoided. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are the main navigation and control systems in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their ground control stations. Without the GNSS signals, the UAV and its ground control stations cannot follow the waypoints of the desired path in jamming environments. In this paper, two new methods for detection of GNSS signal jamming attack for UAV ground control station are proposed based on random matrix theory. By using limiting distribution of mean vector and asymptotic behavior of the defined test statistic, a hypothesis test is introduced and evaluated to detect presence of jamming signal. Simulation results show that the proposed methods have significant performance in terms of detection and false alarm probabilities. Compared to existing methods, at low jamming-to-signal ratio (JSR), more than 2.5 dB improvement is achieved. © 2021 The Korean Institute of Communications and Information Sciences (KICS)

AB  - In this paper, the simple criteria for choosing the working contour of navigation systems during the flight of space unmanned aerial vehicles in a changing noise environment are proposed. Within the framework of a given control system and taking into account the logic of its operation, a route correction system has been built, which ensures that the unmanned aerial vehicle is brought to a given area of space with the required accuracy. Criteria for choosing the working contour of the navigation complex during the flight of an unmanned aerial vehicle, based on the analysis of estimations of the variances of the measurement and reduced measurement noise, are proposed. Simulation of a test mathematical model of INS errors with various external sources of information, as well as simulation based on the data of a laboratory experiment, has been carried out. Analysis of the simulation results showed that the developed algorithmic methods make it possible to increase the efficiency of the navigation systems of an unmanned aerial vehicle when it operates in various jamming conditions. © 2021 Concern CSRI Elektropribor, JSC.

AB  - Real-world performance evaluation of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) requires a considerable amount of time and resources. It is challenging to evaluate and make frequent changes to optimize UAV performance practically. Furthermore, some cyber-attack resistance evaluation tests for UAV networks, like jamming, are illegal to perform in most countries. Simulators are software that enable us to evaluate UAV performance without real-world practical implementation. Simulations make it possible to create, implement, and test scenarios virtually on a computer. There are many simulators available for UAV performance evaluation, but they all differ in functionality and use. It is essential to choose the right simulator based on the requirements and needs of the research. In this paper, we investigated, evaluated, and categorized available UAV simulators to make it easy to choose the right simulation software for UAV performance evaluation. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - In a conventional Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) navigational system Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sensor is often a main source of data for trajectory generation. Even video tracking based systems need some GNSS data for proper work. The goal of this study is to develop an optics-based system to estimate the ground speed of the UAV in the case of the GNSS failure, jamming, or unavailability. The proposed approach uses a camera mounted on the fuselage belly of the UAV. We can obtain the ground speed of the airplane by using the digital cropping, the stabilization of the real time image, and template matching algorithms. By combining the ground speed vector components with measurements of airspeed and altitude, the wind velocity and drift are computed. The obtained data were used to improve efficiency of the video-tracking based on a navigational system. An algorithm allows this computation to be performed in real time on board of a UAV. The algorithm was tested in Software-in-the-loop and implemented on the UAV hardware. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated through the experimental test results. The presented work could be useful for upgrading the existing MUAV products (with embedded cameras) already delivered to the customers only by updating their software. It is especially significant in the case when any necessary hardware upgrades would be economically unjustified or even impossible to be carried out. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This paper considers secure communications for an underlay cognitive radio network (CRN) in the presence of an external eavesdropper (Eve). The secrecy performance of CRNs is usually limited by the primary receiver's interference power constraint. To overcome this issue, we propose to use an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a friendly jammer to interfere Eve in decoding the confidential message from the secondary transmitter. Our goal is to jointly optimize the transmit power and UAV's trajectory in the three-dimensional space to maximize the average achievable secrecy rate of the secondary system. The formulated optimization problem is nonconvex due to the non-convexity of the objective and non-convexity of constraints, which is very challenging to solve. To obtain a suboptimal but efficient solution to the design problem, we first transform it into a more tractable form and then develop an iterative algorithm for its solution by leveraging the inner approximation (IA) framework. Combining tools from IA framework and S-procedure, we further extend the proposed algorithm to a more realistic scenario, where the imperfect location information of ground nodes (including Eve, secondary receiver and primary receiver) is considered, resulting in the average worst-case secrecy rate. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the merits of the proposed algorithms over existing approaches. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

AU  - Zhang, Shuowen

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications
AB  - In this paper, we study the three-dimensional (3D) path planning for a cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to minimize its flying distance from given initial to final locations, while ensuring a target link quality in terms of the expected signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the UAV receiver with each of its associated ground base stations (GBSs) during the flight. To exploit the location-dependent and spatially varying channel as well as interference over the 3D space, we propose a new radio map based path planning framework for the UAV. Specifically, we consider the channel gain map of each GBS that provides its large-scale channel gains with uniformly sampled locations on a 3D grid, which are due to static and large-size obstacles (e.g., buildings) and thus assumed to be time-invariant. Based on the channel gain maps of GBSs as well as their loading factors, we then construct an SINR map that depicts the expected SINR levels over the sampled 3D locations. By leveraging the obtained SINR map, we proceed to derive the optimal UAV path by solving an equivalent shortest path problem (SPP) in graph theory. We further propose a grid quantization approach where the grid points in the SINR map are more coarsely sampled by exploiting the spatial channel/interference correlation over neighboring grids. Then, we solve an approximate SPP over the reduced-size SINR map (graph) with reduced complexity. Numerical results show that the proposed solution can effectively minimize the flying distance/time of the UAV subject to its communication quality constraint, and a flexible trade-off between performance and complexity can be achieved by adjusting the grid quantization ratio in the SINR map. Moreover, the proposed solution significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes without fully exploiting the channel/interference spatial distribution in the network. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

We aim to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the UAV by optimizing its trajectory, subject to the UAV's mobility constraints. However, the formulated problem is difficult to solve due to the non-convex and fractional form of the objective function. Thus, we propose an iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) technique and Dinkelbach's algorithm to solve it. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can strike a better balance between the throughput and energy consumption by the optimized trajectory and thus improve the EE significantly as compared to the benchmark algorithms. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - During the outdoor cruising flight of the UAV, it will often cause problems such as inaccurate positioning information and course to drift due to interference of sensor signal errors, ground effects, airflow, and communication delay. In this paper, an outdoor cruising control system of the quadrotor drone is designed, where the Kalman filter and the Mahony filter are adopted to fuse the sensor data to obtain the attitude to be controlled, and the PID control method is introduced to reduce the external noise to the control system. As a result, the GPS/INS combined navigation method was used to design the quadrotor drone controller. The system improves the anti-jamming capability of the aircraft, has the advantages of real-time, fast response, and high precision, and can realize the positioning cruise function of the quadrotor aircraft in a complex outdoor environment. © Content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence.

To this end, we formulate a UAV trajectory optimization problem to minimize its mission completion time with QoS and security constraints. The imperfect information, dynamic communication environment, and non-convexity make the problem intractable. For these reasons, we propose a novel solution approach, namely Model-Assisted Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, where the communication system model is embedded into Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework to ensure secure communication and shorten the learning process. Numerical results show that our proposed methodology can safeguard security and find the shortest way to finish the mission. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - UAVs have a wide range of application value in border and coastal defense, river inspections and other fields. However,the inspection process of drones will lead to unreliable positioning information due to satellite signal interference or signal deception, which will seriously affect the credible inspection of drones. In response to the above problems, this paper studies the UAV auxiliary positioning system based on image algorithms, and proposes a fast scene matching algorithm named Onboard match. First, Gaussian pyramid is used to preprocess the image to improve the speed of subsequent feature point extraction, and then combined with DOH features Extraction, BRISK for feature description, LSH for feature matching and PROSAC for removal of mismatches compose the overall matching process. It has been experimentally verified that Onboard match achieves real-time and accurate scene matching on the airborne processor, which can effectively assist the UAV's credible inspection mission. Experiments have verified that the matching speed of Onboard-match algorithm on the TX2 onboard is 1.6 times faster than ORB, the most commonly industry-used real-time matching algorithm, and the average matching accuracy rate is 90.5% higher than ORB. The actual verification result on the airborne processor proves that the matching position error of Onbaord match is 4.42m, and the average frame rate on the airborne processor is 21.4FPS, which can realize real-time and accurate scene matching and realize the auxiliary positioning function of the UAV in the system. © 2021 IEEE

AU  - Kinnari, Jouko

AB  - Localization of low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) often relies on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). GNSS are susceptible to both natural disruptions to radio signal and intentional jamming and spoofing by an adversary. A typical way to provide georeferenced localization without GNSS for small UAVs is to have a downward-facing camera and match camera images to a map. The downward-facing camera adds cost, size, and weight to the UAV platform and the orientation limits its usability for other purposes. In this work, we propose a Monte-Carlo localization method for georeferenced localization of an UAV requiring no infrastructure using only inertial measurements, a camera facing an arbitrary direction, and an orthoimage map. We perform orthorectification of the UAV image, relying on a local planarity assumption of the environment, relaxing the requirement of downward-pointing camera. We propose a measure of goodness for the matching score of an orthorectified UAV image and a map. We demonstrate that the system is able to localize globally an UAV with modest requirements for initialization and map resolution. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - This work proposes a novel distributed control framework in which a team of pursuer agents equipped with a radio jamming device cooperate in order to track and radio-jam a rogue target in 3D space, with the ultimate purpose of disrupting its communication and navigation circuitry. The target evolves in 3D space according to a stochastic dynamical model and it can appear and disappear from the surveillance area at random times. The pursuer agents cooperate in order to estimate the probability of target existence and its spatial density from a set of noisy measurements in the presence of clutter. Additionally, the proposed control framework allows a team of pursuer agents to optimally choose their radio transmission levels and their mobility control actions in order to ensure uninterrupted radio jamming to the target, as well as to avoid the jamming interference among the team of pursuer agents. Extensive simulation analysis of the system's performance validates the applicability of the proposed approach. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - The application of NOMA in UAV networks is an effective solution for communications. However, the security risk becomes more serious with the LoS channels and higher transmit power for weaker users in NOMA-UAV networks. In this paper, a UAV-assisted NOMA transmission scheme is proposed to achieve secure downlink transmission via artificial jamming, where a UAV flies straightly to serve multiple ground users in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. Only the closest users to the UAV can be connected in each time slot to achieve high LoS probability. To balance the security and transmission performance, the tradeoff between the jamming power and the sum rate is investigated by jointly optimizing the power allocation, the user scheduling and the UAV trajectory. To address the problem, we first decompose the problem into two subproblems of power allocation and trajectory optimization. Then, they are transformed into convex ones for an iterative algorithm via the first-order Taylor expansion. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - With the rapid development of science and technology, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) have become a new type of weapon in the informatization battlefield by their advantages of low loss and zero casualty rate. In recent years, UAV navigation electromagnetic decoy and electromagnetic interference crashes have activated widespread international attention. The UAV LiDAR detection system is susceptible to electromagnetic interference in a complex electromagnetic environment, which results in inaccurate detection and causes the mission to fail. Therefore, it is very necessary to predict the effects of the electromagnetic environment. Traditional electromagnetic environment effect prediction methods mostly use a single model of mathematical model and machine learning, but the traditional prediction method has poor processing nonlinear ability and weak generalization ability. Therefore, this paper uses the Stacking fusion model algorithm in machine learning to study the electromagnetic environment effect prediction. This paper proposes a Stacking fusion model based on machine learning to predict electromagnetic environment effects. The method consists of Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGB), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree algorithm (GBDT), K Nearest Neighbor algorithm (KNN), and Decision Tree algorithm (DT). Experimental results show that, comprising with the other seven machine learning algorithms, the Stacking fusion model has a better classification prediction accuracy of 0.9762, a lower Hamming code distance of 0.0336, and a higher Kappa coefficient of 0.955. The fusion model proposed in this paper has a better predictive effect on electromagnetic environment effects and is of great significance for improving the accuracy and safety of UAV LiDAR detection systems under the complex electromagnetic environment on the battlefield. © 2021 Min Huang et al.

AB  - Jamming situations taking place as part of anti-drone struggle or military exercises are a threat for civil aviation. During these jamming operations, in order to protect civil aviation operations, segregation zones (also called protection zone in this article) are elaborated in which GNSS ICAO minimum requirements are not guaranteed. Segregation zones refer to the area, determined by the regulator, in which pilots are warned of a potential GNSS service failure because of the jamming. Currently, these protection areas are deduced from the ITU standardized interference mask but it appears that these protection areas are much larger than the observed impacted zone, highlighting thus the inefficiency of the current method. In this article, first a clarification on the interpretation of the interference mask is proposed, in order to explain the difference between the size of the protection zone and the impacted area. Second, a new method is proposed to compute a new protection zone, and this method estimates the true impacted zone considering local RFI situation. The main innovation of this new method is to take into account the situation of the jammer in terms of aeronautical interference level in its local surroundings. The main advantage of this method is the protection area size reduction while still guaranteeing that minimum GNSS ICAO requirements are respected. © 2021 Proceedings of the 34th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2021.

AB  - This paper presents a method based on the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) interference signals to facilitate wide area protection against numerous unintentional drones. The defensive GNSS signals generated by a single signal generator sweep the authentic GNSS signals, and that the signal tracking loop tracks these defensive signals so that the drones can be guided to a safe zone. The proposed algorithm performs a sweep in the measurement domain by adjusting the time offset of the signal generator, which makes it possible to sweep a wider area. To confirm the possibility of wide area protection, we investigated the signal generation method for the transition of signal tracking locks from authentic to defensive signals in situations where a signal generator cannot identify the drones' positions. We examined the time discrepancy between the authentic and defensive signals and performed the worst-case analysis to determine the minimum sweep range of the time offset. The determined minimum sweep range overcomes the influence of time discrepancy and unconditionally deceives multiple drones regardless of the satellite's position, drones' trajectories, and entry timing. To deceive drones approaching a sphere with a radius of 1 km, the minimum sweep range equals approximately 6 and 3 km when the signal generator is 0 and 2-km away from the center of the sweep region, respectively. The simulation results verified the theoretical analysis and showed that the defensive signals transmitted by one signal generator can deceive multiple drones to the center of the sweep region, which is the intended location. © 2013 IEEE.

T2  - IEEE Access
AB  - In modern-day multi-dimensional recreational drones (UAVs), the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) units in- use are commonly fraught with precise-point-positioning (PPP) data errors or inaccuracies, hence, necessitating this work. These data inaccuracies, occasioned by the system's drawbacks such as sudden GPS lock or jamming, embedded device misalignment, drone's limited communication coverage, signaling and detection, all contributes to the system's PPP computation complexity. To mitigate PPP complexity, an intelligent and robust accurate continuous-discrete (ACD) based hybrid cubature-extended Kalman filter (C-EKF) computation model for an integrated GNSS unit is corroborated in this article. More precisely, time updates to the state and parameter sub-vectors for the GNSS unit is accomplished using the third-degree spherical-radial cubature rule. The system's testbed simulation is then conducted using tightly-coupled units of (i) ring laser gyroscope (RLG) and (ii) micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) variants of the inertial measurement unit (IMU) to ascertain the PPP cooperative tendencies. Optimized performance comparisons of the proposed hybrid C-EKF over the existing cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and extended Kalman filter (EKF) models with-respect-to (w.r.t) its probabilistic outages, Yaw error-differences and ergodic capacities are demonstrated and presented. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The high-precision navigation and positioning ability of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) is the key factor to reflect its degree of automation. Visual navigation based on image matching has become one of the important research fields for UAV to realize autonomous navigation, because of its low cost, strong anti-jamming ability, and good location result. However, the visual quality of images captured by UAV will be seriously affected by some factors, such as weak illumination conditions or insufficient performance of its sensors. Resolving a series of degradation of low-light images can improve the visual quality and enhance the performance of UAV visual navigation. In this paper, we propose a novel fully convolutional network based on the Retinex theory to solve the degradations of low-light images captured by UAV, which can improve the visual quality of the images and visual matching performance effectively. At the same time, a visual navigation system is designed based on the proposed network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing methods by a large margin both quantitatively and qualitatively, and effectively improves the performance of the image matching algorithms. The visual navigation system can successfully realize the self-localization of UAV under different illumination conditions. Moreover, we also prove that our method is also effective in other practical tasks (e.g. autonomous driving). © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In order to conduct trajectory spoofing on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) effectively, based on the analysis of the GPS spoofing jamming principle, combined with the control characteristics of the GPS/INS integrated navigation system to carry out the UAV spoofing trajectory planning. Firstly, according to the characteristics of UAV flight, the initial mobility constraint model of UAV is established. Secondly, the spoofing trajectory of UAV is planned under this constraint condition. Two trajectory planning algorithms for extension line and tangent line are proposed. Finally, simulation verification and analysis are conducted according to the proposed algorithms. The results show that both planning methods can deflect the UAV flight path, however, the planning method set by tangent is more strongly biased than the planning method set by the extension line, and the final spoofing effect is better. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAVs, Drones), initially known only for their military applications, are getting increasingly popular in the civil sector as well. Over the military canvas, drones have already proven themselves as a potent force multiplier through unmanned, round-the-clock, long-range and high-endurance missions for surveillance, reconnaissance, search and rescue, and even armed combat applications. With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), commercial deployments of drones are also growing exponentially, ranging from cargo and taxi services to agriculture, disaster relief, risk assessment and monitoring of critical infrastructures. Irrespective of the deployment sector, drones are often entrusted to conduct safety, time and liability critical tasks, thus requiring secure, robust and trustworthy operations. In contrast, the rise in UAVs' demand, coupled with market pressure to reduce size, weight, power and cost (SwaP-C) parameters, has caused vendors to often ignore security aspects, thus inducing serious safety and security threats. As UAVs rely on Global Positioning System (GPS) for positioning and navigation, they can fall prey to GPS jamming and spoofing attacks. The vulnerability of GPS to spoofing has serious implications for UAVs, as victim drones using civil GPS can be misdirected or even completely hijacked for malicious intents, as already demonstrated in several academic research efforts using commercially available GPS spoofing hardware. Beside UAVs, GPS spoofing attacks are equally applicable to other GPS-dependent platforms, including manned aircraft, ground vehicles, and cellular systems. This paper conducts a comprehensive review of GPS spoofing threats, with a special focus on their applicability over UAVs and other GPS-dependent mobile platforms. It presents a novel taxonomy of GPS spoofing attacks and critically analyzes different spoofing techniques based upon placement of spoofing device, attack stealthiness, attack methodologies, and objectives of the attacker. We also discuss some of the recent experiments from open literature which utilized commercially available hardware for successfully conducting spoofing attacks. © 2021 Khan et al.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely applied in internet-of-things (IoT) scenarios while the security for UAV communications remains a challenging problem due to the broadcast nature of the line-of-sight (LoS) wireless channels. This article investigates the security problems for dual UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, where one UAV is invoked to help the ground terminal devices (TDs) to compute the offloaded tasks and the other one acts as a jammer to suppress the vicious eavesdroppers. In our framework, minimum secure computing capacity maximization problems are proposed for both the time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme by jointly optimizing the communication resources, computation resources, and UAVs' trajectories. The formulated problems are non-trivial and challenging to be solved due to the highly coupled variables. To tackle these problems, we first transform them into more tractable ones then a block coordinate descent based algorithm and a penalized block coordinate descent based algorithm are proposed to solve the problems for TDMA and NOMA schemes, respectively. Finally, numerical results show that the security computing capacity performance of the systems is enhanced by the proposed algorithms as compared with the benchmarks. Meanwhile, the NOMA scheme is superior to the TDMA scheme for security improvement. © 1972-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Thanks to their quick placement and high flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be very useful in the current and future wireless communication systems. With a growing number of smart devices and infrastructure-free communication networks, it is necessary to legitimately monitor these networks to prevent crimes. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to exploit the flexibility of the UAV for legitimate monitoring via joint trajectory design and energy management. The system includes a suspicious transmission link with a terrestrial transmitter and a terrestrial receiver, and a UAV to monitor the suspicious link. The UAV can adjust its positions and send jamming signal to the suspicious receiver to ensure successful eavesdropping. Based on this model, we first develop an approach to minimize the overall jamming energy consumption of the UAV. Building on a judicious (re-)formulation, an alternating optimization approach is developed to compute a locally optimal solution in polynomial time. Furthermore, we model and include the propulsion power to minimize the overall energy consumption of the UAV. Leveraging the successive convex approximation method, an effective iterative approach is developed to find a feasible solution fulfilling the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Extensive numerical results are provided to verify the merits of the proposed schemes. © 2002-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The secure performance of wideband cognitive radio networks (CRNs) with OFDMA (orthogonal frequency-division multiple access) achieved by using physical layer security is low due to the severe channel fading and the limit transmit power of the secondary base station (SBS). To improve the secure performance, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted jamming wideband CRNs is studied where a UAV transmits the jamming signal to interfere with the eavesdropper (Eve) and the SBS provides communication services for the secondary users (SUs) over multiple sub-carrier channels. The total average secrecy rate of the secondary network is maximized by jointly optimizing the sub-carrier allocation, the jamming UAV trajectory, and the transmission power of the UAV and the SBS. An alternative algorithm is proposed to solve the challenging non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results verify the efficiency of our proposed algorithm and show that UAV-assisted jamming is beneficial for improving secure performance of wideband CRNs. It is also shown that our proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of the total average secrecy rate. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Performance of global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) mounted on aerial platforms could be degraded by the presence of jamming or spoofing threats. Detection of jamming and spoofing is essential considering practical applications of satellite navigation in passenger aircrafts, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), helicopters and fighters. Different algorithms and methods have been proposed for detection of these threats; however, their usage has many limitations because of their demanding weight, size and computational complexity, when embedded on aerial systems. In this study, the authors develop a theoretical framework to detect the presence of the threat of UAVs. The idea is based on the fact that, due to the UAV motion, the samples of received signal power from a fixed threat and from a GNSS satellite have different empirical probability density functions. Moreover, by using two antennas (an omnidirectional and a down-tilted-directional), they introduce a new method to distinguish between aerial and ground-based threats. The proposed algorithms have a low-computational burden and can consider the fading loss as well. Simulation results show the superior performance of the proposed methods, in terms of detection and false alarm probability, compared to the existing methods. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.

AB  - Lately, a rising number of incidents between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and airplanes have been reported in airports and airfields. In order to help cope with the problem of unauthorized UAV operations, in this paper we evaluate the use of low cost SDR platforms (software defined radio) for the implementation of a jammer able to generate an effective interfering signal aimed at the GPS navigation system. Using a programmable BladeRF x40 platform from Nuand and the GNU radio software development toolkit, several interference techniques were studied and evaluated, considering the spectral efficiency, energy efficiency and complexity. It was shown that the tested approaches are capable of stopping the reliable reception of the radionavigation signal in real-life scenarios, neutralizing the capacity for autonomous operation of the vehicle. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AU  - Wu, Yang

AU  - Guan, Xinrong
AB  - In this paper, we investigate the UAV-UAV communication system, wherein a source UAV transmits signals to a destination UAV in the presence of a malicious jammer. We aim to minimize the flight time by optimizing the trajectory of UAVs with limited turning angle subject to the required minimum information to be transmitted. However, the formulated problem is non-convex and intractable to solve. Thus, we propose an iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to solve it with the aid of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and Young inequality. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can provide corresponding trajectory design with different jammer's deployment, and the freer turning angle along with the fewer required transmitted information can lead to shorter flight time. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - An attack on a drone is a technique used to stop or obstruct the drone's working system. These attacks can also be used to determine security vulnerabilities to drones. The DJI Phantom 3 Standard is a wifi-based quadcopter. In this study, navigation attacks in the form of GPS jamming and GPS spoofing were carried out on the DJI Phantom 3 Standard drone. The goal of this GPS attack in this study is to determine and analyze the extent of vulnerability in the DJI Phantom 3 Standard commercial drone GPS. The GPS jamming attack uses jamming signals with the GNU Radio Companion (GRC) app. For GPS spoofing attacks using GPS-SDR-SIM tools to create fake GPS signals for drones. The GPS attack in this study uses the BladeRF X40 Software Defined Radio (SDR) device as the main device. The results of this study indicate that GPS jamming and GPS spoofing attacks can disrupt the GPS signal and even make the drone lose control. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is becoming common in our daily lives and cellular networks are effective in providing support services to UAVs for long-range applications. The main target of this paper is to propose a modified form of well-known graph search methods i.e., Dijkstra and A-star also known as Aalgorithm, for quality-aware trajectory planning of the UAV. The aerial quality map of the propagation environment is used as an input for UAV trajectory planning, and the quality metric considered for this work is Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR). The UAV trajectory is quantified in terms of three performance metrics i.e., path length, Quality Outage Ratio (QOR), and maximum Quality Outage Duration (QOD). The proposed path planning algorithm aims at achieving a trade-off between the path length and other quality metrics of the UAV trajectory. The simulations are performed using an agreed 3GPP macro cell LOS scenario for UAVs in MATLAB. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the QOR by slightly increasing the path length compared with the naive shortest path. Similarly, the outage avoidance path achieves high QOR at the expense of large path length, and our proposed method finds a compromise and provides an optimal quality-aware path. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Current research on Vertical Takeoff and Landing Vehicles (VTOLs) like urban air mobility, parcel delivery, search and rescue or human aid require precise autonomous takeoff and landing systems. Safe and reliable flight operations have to be ensured even for challenging conditions like fog, night or direct sunlight. In addition, robust, low-cost and low-maintenance infrastructure is required. Since using the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is not reliable in particular close to landing areas due to multi path errors or jamming, an GNSS denied navigation technique is required.This paper presents a radar based autonomous takeoff and landing system for VTOLs. The localization system requires only passive radar reflectors on the ground. A standard automotive radar, as used for driver assistance systems, is applied for detection. Fusion with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) further improves the localization accuracy. A dedicated landing platform is developed along with a flight guidance such that autonomous precision takeoff and landing can be conducted.Our system has been tested in extensive flight experiments. Indoor flight experiments proved the overall system performance even with bad visual conditions which we simulated with a fog machine. The system achieved a high localization accuracy with a mean absolute error below 0.1 m. All test flights resulted in a successful landing in the center of our landing platform. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - In precision agriculture, autonomous ground and aerial vehicles can lead to favourable improvements in field operations, extending crop scouting to large fields and performing field tasks in a timely and effective way. However, automated navigation and operations within a complex scenarios require specific and robust path planning and navigation control. Thus, in addition to proper knowledge of their instantaneous position, robotic vehicles and machines require an accurate spatial description of their environment. An innovative modelling framework is presented to semantically interpret 3D point clouds of vineyards and to generate low complexity 3D mesh models of vine rows. The proposed methodology, based on a combination of convex hull filtration and minimum area c-gon design, reduces the amount of instances required to describe the spatial layout and shape of vine canopies allowing the amount of data to be reduced without losing relevant crop shape information. The algorithm is not hindered by complex scenarios, such as non-linear vine rows, as it is able to automatically process non uniform vineyards. Results demonstrated a data reduction of about 98%; from the 500 Mb ha<sup>−1</sup> required to store the original dataset to 7.6 Mb ha<sup>−1</sup> for the low complexity 3D mesh. Reducing the amount of data is crucial to reducing computational times for large original datasets, thus enabling the exploitation of 3D point cloud information in real-time during field operations. When considering scenarios involving cooperating machines and robots, data reduction will allow rapid communication and data exchange between in field actors. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The paper describes a comparative study among BBN, PBN and ST jamming strategies against global positioning system (GPS), specifically for a Coarse Acquisition (C/A) signal. In addition, the design, implementation and first tests of a jammer based on this study were realized, which in future works can be used as a mechanism to block the navigation signal of UAVs. To achieve the comparative study, both the parameters of the target signal and mathematical models were used to estimate the effects of the jamming strategies on the signal; as a result, the most suitable is the ST jamming. On the other hand, a helix antenna was designed and implemented for this jammer. Finally, the first tests resulted in the jammer capable of completely blocking the GPS signal of a mobile phone located 60 meters away, with an estimated JSR of 83.6 dB. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to meet the requirements of diverse and efficient communication in the future, which act as aerial base stations (ABSs) with a better line-of-sight communication channels in air-to-ground communication networks. However, resource allocation, interference management and path planning of UAV ABSs have become a series of challenging problems. In this paper, trajectory design and downlink power control of multi-type UAV ABSs are jointly investigated. In order to meet the signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) requirements of users, each UAV ABS needs to adjust its position and transmission power. We propose a non-cooperative mean-field-type game (MFTG) model to jointly optimize the trajectory and transmission power of UAV ABS based on the interactions among multiple communication links. In order to simplify the problem, we cluster the users in the given area to get the initial deployment of the UAV ABSs. Furthermore, the discrete MFTG problem is solved by the proposed mean field Q (MFQ)-learning algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can converge to the equilibrium solution, and reduce the energy cost of each UAV ABS effectively with satisfying the SINR. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The status of multi UAV cooperative cluster operation in the military field is more and more prominent. Its electronic interference to the radar network is always the focus of military electronic warfare. This paper studies the rules and characteristics of deceptive Jamming of multiple UAVs to radar network, and focuses on how to use the least number of UAVs to generate fake track deception to radar network. This paper starts with the geometric space relationship between the UAV and the radar network. Based on the geometric spatial relationship between the false track of UAV and radar network, a concise mathematical model is established, and the analysis and solution flow of the model is given, which provides important enlightenment for improving the electronic countermeasure capability of the grouped UAV. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The research object of this article is a route correction system of an unmanned aerial vehicle. In order to correct the flight path of the UAV under study, an airborne radar system is used. In the case of active jamming, the radar image cannot be used for route correction. Therefore, the onboard navigation system with algorithm correction is proposed. The error compensation scheme of navigation system is used in the output signal, and the prediction model of system error is constructed by the algorithm. The predictive model is constructed using the genetic algorithm and group method of data handling. The quality of algorithms for constructing predictive model is compared by mathematical model. Algorithmic support that functions with the radar system and in conditions of active interference (these signals are unavailable) for the UAV navigation system has been formed. Correction algorithms for autonomous UAV navigation systems including genetic algorithms and prediction algorithms have been developed. The simulation results prove the performance and efficiency of the developed correction algorithm, which shows that the accuracy of navigation system can be improved and the UAV problems can be solved by using this algorithm. © 2020 Concern CSRI Elektropribor, JSC.

AB  - Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) require highly reliable navigation information. Generally, navigation systems with the inertial navigation system (INS) and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) have been widely used. However, the GNSS is vulnerable to jamming and spoofing. The terrain referenced navigation (TRN) technique can be used to solve this problem. In this study, to obtain reliable navigation information even if a GNSS is not available or the degree of terrain roughness is not determined, we propose a federated filter based INS/GNSS/TRN integrated navigation system. We also introduce a TRN system that combines batch processing and an auxiliary particle filter to ensure stable flight of UAVs even in a long-term GNSS-denied environment. As an altimeter sensor for the TRN system, an interferometric radar altimeter (IRA) is used to obtain reliable navigation accuracy in high altitude flight. In addition, a parallel computing technique with general purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) is applied to process a high resolution terrain database and a nonlinear filter in real-time on board. Finally, the performance of the proposed system is verified through software-in-the-loop (SIL) tests and captive flight tests in a GNSS unavailable environment. © 2020 by the authors.

TI  - Common Throughput Maximization for UAV-Enabled Interference Channel with Wireless Powered Communications
AU  - Xie, Lifeng
AU  - Xu, Jie

T2  - IEEE Transactions on Communications
AB  - This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled two-user interference channel for wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs). In this system, two UAVs wirelessly charge two low-power Internet-of-things (IoT)-devices on the ground and collect information from them. We consider two scenarios when both UAVs cooperate in energy transmission and/or information reception via interference coordination and coordinated multi-point (CoMP), respectively. For both scenarios, the UAVs' trajectories are designed to not only enhance the wireless power transfer (WPT) efficiency in the downlink, but also mitigate the co-channel interference for wireless information transfer (WIT) in the uplink. In particular, the objective is to maximize the uplink common (minimum) throughput of the two IoT-devices over a finite UAV mission period, by jointly optimizing the trajectories of both UAVs and the downlink/uplink wireless resource allocation, subject to the maximum flying speed and collision avoidance constraints for UAVs, as well as the individual energy neutrality constraints at IoT-devices. Under both scenarios with interference coordination and CoMP, we first obtain the optimal solutions to the two common-rate maximization problems for the special case with sufficiently long UAV mission duration. Next, we obtain high-quality solutions for the practical case with finite UAV mission duration by using the alternating optimization and successive convex approximation (SCA). Numerical results show that the proposed designs significantly outperform benchmark schemes, and the utilization of CoMP achieves much higher uplink throughput than interference coordination. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely applied in the field of wireless communication. However, due to the inherent broadcasting characteristics of wireless media, the realization of ground to UAV communication still faces many challenges when there are eavesdroppers on the ground. We consider a new scenario where a jammer UAV tends to interfere with the eavesdroppers to guarantee secrecy performance. Then, the flight trajectory of UAV is optimized to obtain the maximized average secrecy rate. The optimization problem we proposed is non-convex and it's very complicated. To solve this problem, we optimize the increment of UAV trajectory iteration and the non-convex optimization problem is decomposed into the convex problem of each iteration. The feasibility of this method is verified by numerical simulation. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Owing to small size, sensing capabilities and autonomous nature, the Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) have enormous applications in various areas e.g., remote sensing, navigation, archaeology, journalism, environmental science, and agriculture. However, the un-monitored deployment of UAVs called the amateur drones (AmDr) can lead to serious security threats and risk to human life and infrastructure. Therefore, timely detection of the AmDr is essential for the protection and security of sensitive organizations, human life and other vital infrastructure. AmDrs can be detected using different techniques based on sound, video, thermal, and radio frequencies. However, the performance of these techniques is limited in sever atmospheric conditions. In this paper, we propose an efficient un-supervise machine learning approach of independent component analysis (ICA) to detect various acoustic signals i.e., sounds of bird, airplanes, thunderstorm, rain, wind and the UAVs in practical scenario. After unmixing the signals, the features like Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), the power spectral density (PSD) and the Root Mean Square Value (RMS) of the PSD are extracted by using ICA. The PSD and the RMS of PSD signals are extracted by first passing the signals from octave band filter banks. Based on the above features the signals are classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM)and K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)to detect the presence or absence of AmDr. Unique feature of the proposed technique is the detection of a single or multiple AmDrs at a time in the presence of multiple acoustic interfering signals. The proposed technique is verified through extensive simulations and it is observed that the RMS values of PSD with KNN performs better than the MFCC with KNN and SVM. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Autonomous systems are rapidly becoming an integrated part of the modern life. Safe and secure navigation and control of these systems present significant challenges in the presence of uncertainties, physical failures, and cyber attacks. In this paper, we formulate a navigation and control problem for autonomous systems using a multilevel control structure, in which the high-level reference commands are limited by a saturation function, whereas the low-level controller tracks the reference by compensating for disturbances and uncertainties. For this purpose, we consider a class of nested, uncertain, multiple-input–multiple-output systems subject to reference command saturation, possibly with nonminimum phase zeros. A multirate output-feedback L<inf>1</inf> adaptive controller is developed as the low-level controller. The sampled-data (SD) design of this controller facilitates the direct implementation on digital computers, where the input/output signals are available at discrete time instances with different sampling rates. In addition, stealthy zero-dynamics attacks become detectable by considering a multirate SD formulation. Robust stability and performance of the overall closed-loop system with command saturation and multirate L<inf>1</inf> adaptive control are analyzed. Simulation scenarios for navigation and control of a fixed-wing drone under failures/attacks are provided to validate the theoretical findings. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - High accuracy GNSS-based positioning and navigation is required by an increasing number of applications in urban environments. The development is to a large degree driven by the advent of self-driving and autonomous vehicles, increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), and increasing use of outdoor robots. Further, the network real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning methodology is well known as a mean to obtain high accuracy GNSS-based positioning in real-time using GNSS carrier-phase data. The Testbed in Aarhus for Precision Positioning and Autonomous Systems (TAPAS) is built around an RTK system based on a high-density network of 11 reference stations in the city of Aarhus in Denmark. Thus, TAPAS is an augmentation system providing cm-level position accuracy for GNSS-based applications. Using the TAPAS testbed, this paper presents analyses of jamming and multipath in order to characterize the robustness of high accuracy GNSS based positioning in urban environments, when a high-density network RTK is used for augmentation. Analyses of jamming incidents registered at the 11 reference station of TAPAS throughout the year of 2019 show that a total of 1934 jamming incidents were detected. The jamming incidents were further analyzed and it is revealed that most incidents occur during business hours on weekdays, more incidents are found for reference stations located close to larger roads, and when analyzing the impact on positioning performance for high accuracy multi-frequency carrier phase-based positioning it is shown that the effect on end-user position accuracy is very small. Further, multiple dynamic vehicle-based tests using the TAPAS platform were carried out with the purpose of analyzing positioning performance and the effects of multipath. Data was collected using three different GNSS antennas, three different GNSS receivers and two different GNSS/INS systems. Results showed that high-end geodetic equipment outperformed new evolving multi-band multi-constellation mass-market receivers. Despite substantial differences in performance between the antennas and receivers, multipath still severely degraded the positioning results for all equipment grades. © 2020 Proceedings of the 33rd International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation, ION GNSS+ 2020.

AB  - The generated amount of data on high flying platforms like aircrafts, satellites and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) increases continuously, due to the technical improvement of modern sensor systems. The resulting demands for higher data rates on airborne and space platforms motivates the development of Laser Communication terminals for aircrafts and satellites in the last years. DLR’s Institute of Communications and Navigation has a successful track record in developing Free Space Optical (FSO) terminals for flying platforms like stratospheric balloons, aircrafts and small satellites to transfer data from moving platforms down to earth in real-time. Beside the advantages of FSO such as high data rates and a secure transfer channel against Radio Frequency (RF) interferences, a direct line of sight is mandatory for a successful link. Traditional RF-Communication is more robust and less effected by atmospheric disturbances or weather conditions. Thus, new system concepts have been developed to benefit from the provided high data rates of the FSO and the reliability of RF-Communication technologies. As part of this trend, DLR has developed and demonstrated a Hybrid FSO/RF-communication system capable of overcoming the spurious effects of the atmosphere. This paper gives an overview about DLR’s current studies and developments with the goal to combine the advantages of FSO and RF-Communication. It discusses possible implementation concepts on different platforms and presents experimental results of the implemented FSO/RF hybrid communication system operating for airborne, optical downlinks at 1Gbps. © 2020 SPIE.

TI  - Detection Method About GNSS Deception Jamming Signal Based on Optical Flow Computation Assistance
AU  - Shi, Rong
AU  - Yan, Jian

T2  - Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering
AB  - With the increasing dependence of civil infrastructure on the satellite navigation system such as positioning, speed measurement and time service in recent years, the threat of navigation deception jamming becomes more and more serious. So the effective detection on navigation deception signal has become a recent research hotspot. Although various deception detection methods have been proposed continuously, due to the limitation of various boundary conditions, there are few practical applications in engineering. In this paper, the image sensors such as cameras, which are widely used on UAV platforms, are used to process the continuous output of ground imaging data. Based on optical flow computation, the real motion speed of the platform can be obtained in real time. The navigation deception jammer can only affect the satellite navigation receiver, but it cannot control the movement mode of the platform. Therefore, the navigation receiver captured and influenced by deception jammer can be judged by contrasting the velocity of the optical flow measurement with that from the satellite navigation receiver. When the navigation deception jamming signal comes from the same direction, this direction can also be estimated by combining the measurement of reference frequency with the specific motion of the platform. Finally, the feasibility and validity of above approach are verified by simulations. Moreover, the existing hardware modules on the platform can be made use of, and signal processing software only needs to be added to enhance the anti-deception ability of the existing platform. So it has good engineering application values. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - The high precision (centimetre accuracy) positioning systems are set to play a key role in revolutionising smart farming, self-driving cars, drone deliveries, heavy machine navigation, etc. With so much at stake the technology also needs protection from an intentional sabotage or denial of service. It is very easy with current satellite-based navigation jammers to disrupt a navigation service. Our proposed technology solves this challenge in a compact and cost-effective way. Compared to normal navigation patch antennas our proposed dual ring antenna offers over 30 dB of protection. Thus, if a patch antenna-based navigation system is disturbed at 1 watt of interference power, it will take 1000 watts to disrupt navigation system working on our proposed system. With the size of only 130 mm ×130 mm and cheap large-scale manufacturing, our proposed antenna is perfectly suitable for applications for safety and prosperity of the smart nation-based living. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided jamming technique for enabling physical layer keyless security in scenarios where the exact eavesdropper location is unknown. We assume that the unknown eavesdropper location is within an ellipse characterizing the coverage region of the transmitter. By sequentially optimizing the transmit power, the flight path of the UAV and its jamming power, we aim at maximizing the average secrecy rate with arbitrary eavesdropper location. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal flight path obtains better secrecy rate performance compared to that using direct UAV flight path encasing the transmitter and the legitimate receiver. Most importantly, even with the unknown eavesdropper location, we obtained a secrecy rate that is comparable to a scenario when the eavesdropper's location is known. However, the average secrecy rate with the unknown eavesdropper location varies depending on the proximity of the eavesdropper to the known location of the transmitter. We also observe that due to the UAV-aided jamming, the average secrecy rate stabilizes at some point even though the average received envelope power of the eavesdropper increases. This essentially demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Intentional interference in satellite navigation is becoming an increasing threat for modern systems relying on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). In particular, critical applications such as aviation can be severely affected by un-detected and un-mitigated interference and therefore interference management solutions are crucial to be employed. Methods to cope with such intentional interference enclose interference detection, interference mitigation, interference classification, and interference localization. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of interference management methods developed in the last four decades by the research community. After reviewing the main concepts of GNSS-based navigation, the interference and interference management solutions are classified, with a particular focus on the two major threats in GNSS navigation, namely jamming and spoofing. Mathematical models, comparative tables for various interference management solutions, such as detection, localization, mitigation, and classification, as well as comparative numerical results based on several selected algorithms are also presented. We especially focus on algorithms relying on omni-directional antennas, which do not require additional specific antennas to be installed on the aircraft and thus reduce the costs of retrofit and installation. © 1998-2012 IEEE.

TI  - The air object tracking in 3D space using distance measurements
AU  - Kraszewski, Tomasz

AB  - The widespread availability of global navigation satellite signals has become so obvious that it is difficult to imagine their absence. However, under conditions of severe intentional interference, these signals can be degraded (spoofing) or blocked (jamming). It becomes necessary to search for solutions that allow to create your own location system operating in the local coordinate system. The ultrawideband modules that measure distances (that are on the institute's equipment) can be used for this purpose. Therefore, an attempt was made to analyze algorithms based on the measurement of this parameter that allow the location and tracking of the air objects (drone) in 3D space. Although the use of radio waves is also assumed here, the spectrum of the signal is dispersed. This allows you to avoid detecting signals and thereby avoiding interference. The adopted method also gives potential opportunities to build an indoor positioning system where satellite system signals are unavailable. Studies have been carried out for various air object trajectories in open space. They were analysed using the ordinary least squares method, the extended Kalman filter and its modification. Graphic imagery of trajectory and calculated values of traced trajectory errors for different system configurations are shown. On this basis, the implemented algorithms were evaluated. © SPIE.

TI  - Leveraging Jamming to Help Drones Complete Their Mission

T2  - IEEE Access
AB  - We propose JAM-ME, an autonomous jamming-assisted navigation system that allows a drone to accomplish its mission even in the presence of an anti-drone jamming protection system. In this contribution, we review the current state-of-the-art highlighting how current solutions to respond to drones are completely ineffective against JAM-ME. In particular, we introduce our solution and its theoretical framework, and later we relax a few constraints of the baseline model (adding wind drift, and allowing the target to be randomly placed within the jammed area). Moreover, we run extensive simulations that do support our findings: even under the combined action of jamming and wind drift, the drone can reach a target randomly deployed in the jamming area-any other drone, under the same conditions, would have simply failed. As per the overhead, under very conservative assumptions, JAM-ME experiences an average overhead of 70%; however, note that such overhead can be reduced by at least a tenfold factor in practical settings-discussed in the paper. Finally, we highlight the intrinsic limitations of our solution, potential countermeasures, and new jamming strategies that can pave the way to further research. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This paper investigates a multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled wireless communication, where a number of ground nodes (GNs) are scheduled to communicate with UAVs in the presence of jammers with imperfect location information. Considering different quality of service (QoS) requirements for a wide range of applications, we aim to improve the minimum throughput, the average throughput, and the delay-constrained minimum throughput of all GNs, respectively, via the joint design of UAVs' trajectories, GNs' scheduling and power allocation. However, the formulated optimization problems are difficult to solve due to the non-convex and combinatorial nature. To overcome this difficulty, we propose two block coordinate descent (BCD) based algorithms to solve them sub-optimally with the aid of slack variables, successive convex approximation (SCA) technique and S-procedure. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms outperforms the benchmark algorithms and offers a considerable gain in the view of different QoS requirements, giving a certain practical significance. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Small unmanned aerial vehicles are widely used in urban space because of its flexibility and maneuverability. However, there are full of dynamic obstacles and immobile obstacles which will affect safe flying in urban space. In this paper, a novel integrated path planning approach for unmanned aerial vehicles is presented, which is consisted of three steps. First, a time-environment dynamic map is constructed to represent obstacles by introducing time axis. Second, unmanned aerial vehicles’ flyable paths are explored based on breadth-first algorithm. Third, a path planning method using A* algorithm and local trace-back model is designed in order to discover sub-optimal feasible path rapidly in unmanned aerial vehicles’ field of view. Finally, the simulation results have illustrated that the proposed method can ensure unmanned aerial vehicles’ autonomous path planning safely and effectively in urban space crowded with obstacles. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - As a supplement of mobile communication in Fifth generation mobile networks (5G), Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are playing an important role in user coverage. When base stations (BSs) are not able to serve all users in hot spots, deployable UAVs are required to mitigate the burden of BSs and maximize the access number of users. Besides, thanks to the controllable mobility, UAVs can provide better coverage for the mobile users with high velocity or fixed direction. Therefore, it is important to solve the problem of the trajectory planing of multiple UAVs. In this paper, we propose a UAV trajectory optimization strategy to maximize the access number of moving users. Firstly, according to the mobility of UAVs and the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) requirements of users, we formulate the UAV's trajectory optimization problem, which is an atypical mixed integer linear programming problem (MILP). Then, a convex optimization problem is obtained by correlation relaxation of the previous atypical MILP. Finally, we propose a practicable trajectory optimization algorithm with limited times of iteration. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can maximize the access number of users while maintaining enough SINR. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - This paper investigates a multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enabled cooperative secure transmission scheme in the presence of multiple potential eavesdroppers. Specifically, multiple source UAVs (SUAVs) send confidential information to multiple legitimate ground users, and in the meantime, multiple jamming UAVs cooperatively transmit interference signals to multiple eavesdroppers in order to improve the legitimate users achievable secrecy rate. By taking into account the limited energy budget of UAV, our goal is to maximize the system secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), namely the achievable secrecy rate per energy consumption unit, by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, transmit power, and user scheduling under the constraints of UAV mobility as well as the maximum transmit power. The resulting optimization problem is shown to be a non-convex and mixed-integer fractional optimization problem, which is challenging to solve. We decompose the original problem into three sub-problems, and then, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed by leveraging the block coordinate descent method and Dinkelbach method in combination with successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the other benchmarks significantly in terms of the system SEE. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in various fields, which mainly relies on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) to obtain position information. However, fastmoving jamming poses a big challenge for UAV navigation. This motivates us to develop new robust adaptive beamforming technique that is capable of enhancing the navigation signal and suppressing the jamming efficiently. Since the navigation signal and jamming present non-Gaussianity in statistics, the minimum dispersion distortionless response (MDDR) beamformer is utilized, which exhibits better performance of non-Gaussian signal reception over the minimum variance-based beamformer. To suppress the fast-moving jamming, the minimum power constraint is added to the optimization problem regarding to the MDDR beamformer, leading to a resultant problem with a quadratic constraint. Furthermore, instead of the quadratic constraint, a linear version is derived under the power constraint to achieve a shape null sector towards the fast-moving jamming, and as a consequence, a linearly constrained MDDR beamforming is established. This allows us to develop two algorithms, i.e., quasi-MVDR algorithm and Newton s method, to accelerate the solution. Simulation results show that the proposed beamformer is able to suppress the fast-moving jamming efficiently for UAV navigation. © 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

TI  - Detecting signal spoofing and jamming attacks in UAV networks using a lightweight IDS
AU  - Arthur, Menaka Pushpa
AB  - In recent times, security issues pertaining to drones have received a great deal of attention from researchers in networking and communication circles, given their applications in the civilian and defence domains. Object collision avoidance over a trajectory is the only built-in security mechanism in the autopilot system of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). This mechanism, however, cannot protect drones from signal spoofing and hacking attacks. Attacks on UAVs can be triggered from either the ground or flying vehicles in the transmission vicinity medium, by means of which attackers get to control flight operations or manipulate the UAV's autopilot system. An intermittent network connection that disrupts communication in UAVs exacerbates the problem. Hence, a deep learning-based, adaptive Intrusion Detection System is needed for a drone to identify its intruders and ensure its safe return-to-home (RTH). In the proposed IDS, Self-Taught Learning (STL) with a multiclass SVM is used to maintain the high true positive rate of the IDS, even in uncharted territory. A self-healing method in IDS recovery phase uses the Deep-Q Network, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for dynamic route learning to facilitate the drone's safe return home. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed IDS against cyber security attacks on UAVs in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Aiming at the cooperative reconnaissance problem of dual UAVs with reconnaissance function and jamming function in complex environment, a path finding algorithm based on positive sum game is proposed to achieve the global optimum and ensure the safety of UAV. Firstly, the mathematical model of environment and flight constraints is established, the UAV is regarded as the participant in the game, the path planning of the UAV is regarded as the optimal strategy of the participants. The design payoff function includes the UAV's function, cooperative priority, flight constraint, the length of flight path, collision prevention, threats, etc. By solving the optimal solution in the game to obtain the optimal path of all UAVs. Simulation results show that the proposed method can be implemented in a complex environment, in which, UAVs cooperate with each other to cover and reconnaissance, ensure their own safety and make up for their lack of execution ability. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we show, for the first time in the literature, that the common assumption that jamming is an effective way to neutralise drones, is false. In particular, we propose JAM-ME a solution that allows the drone to exploit an adversarial jamming signal to implement an emergency but yet effective navigation system, enabling the drone to accomplish its mission. Our contributions are manifold: first, we revise the jamming based anti-drone techniques; second, we introduce a basic model for JAM-ME and accompanying mathematical tool-rooted in systems control theory. Further, we show through an extensive simulation campaign that JAM-ME do allow a drone to accomplish its mission in a jammed area. Finally, we also discuss possible techniques to mitigate the impact of JAM-ME as well as its limitations, and we conclude highlighting further research directions. We believe that our contribution, other than being interesting on its own, can pave the way for further research in the highlighted directions, as well as having a compelling follow up from a practitioner point of view. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Although consumer drones have been used in many attacks, besides specific methods such as jamming, very little research has been conducted on systematical methods to counter these drones. In this paper, we develop generic methods to compromise drone position control algorithms in order to make malicious drones deviate from their targets. Taking advantage of existing methods to remotely manipulate drone sensors through cyber or physical attacks (e.g., [1], [2]), we exploited the weaknesses of position estimation and autopilot controller algorithms on consumer drones in the proposed attacks. For compromising drone position control, we first designed two state estimation attacks: A maximum False Data Injection (FDI) attack and a generic FDI attack that compromised the Kalman-Filter-based position estimation (arguably the most popular method). Furthermore, based on the above attacks, we proposed two attacks on autopilot-based navigation, to compromise the actual position of a malicious drone. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first piece of work in this area. Our analysis and simulation results show that the proposed attacks can significantly affect the position estimation and the actual positions of drones. We also proposed potential countermeasures to address these attacks. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are being more and more widely deployed. Although, initially most UAVs were controlled by a pilot, autonomy has increased. This requires the flight controller in the UAV to accurately know the current system state. Knowing the current position is of crucial importance. Fortunately, this can be reliably obtained from a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver. Recently, it was shown that criminal GNSS jamming frequently occurs. First, this paper analyzes the risk posed by off-the-shelf civilian GPS jammers to UAVs. Then, as the main contribution of this paper, a countermeasure is described and implemented using custom hardware and software that allows the control radio to be used as a backup navigation source. Finally, the proposed solution is tested in ideal and field conditions. It is shown that good performance can be obtained by the presented system, almost without additional system cost. © 2007-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Satellite navigation is more and more important in a plethora of very different application fields, ranging from bank transactions to shipping, from autonomous driving to aerial applications, such as avionics as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Due to the increasing dependency on satellite navigation, the need for robust systems able to counteract unintentional or intentional interferences is growing. When considering interference-robust designs; however, the complexity increases. Top performance is obtained through the use of multi-antenna receivers capable of performing spatial nulling in the direction of the interference signals. In particular, mobile applications (aeronautics, UAVs, automotive) have a substantial interest in robust navigation, but they also have the strongest constraints on the weight and available places for installation, with the use of bigger and heavier systems posing a substantial problem. In order to overcome this limitation, the present work shows a miniaturized five element (4+1) antenna array, which operates at the L1/E1 band (with array capability), as well as at the L5/E5 band (as a single antenna). The proposed antenna array is able to fit into a 3.5-inch footprint, i.e., is compliant with the most widespread footprints for single antennas. Moreover, it is capable of multiband operation and meets the requirements of dual-frequency multi-constellation (DFMC) systems. Thanks to its extreme miniaturization and its compliance with current airborne single antenna footprints, the presented antenna array is suitable for easy integration in future aerial platforms, while enabling robustness and enhancing interference mitigation techniques using multi-antenna processing. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - This paper mainly investigates the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks under the threat of a static malicious jammer. While taking the flying process of the user (UAV transmitter-receiver pair) into consideration, we propose a joint power and trajectory optimization method. Moreover, a Stackelberg framework is formulated to solve the proposed optimization problem. In addition, a joint power and trajectory optimization algorithm (JPTOA) based on best-response (BR) is designed to obtain the user's strategy as well as Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) in each time stage. Furthermore, as an extension of single stage optimization, the I-step exploration and one-step decision (IEOD) scheme is designed to enhance the user's cumulative utility. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the performance of the proposed JPTOA scheme. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Given a cooperative mission consisting of multiple tasks spatially distributed, an aerial robotic swarm’s decision-making issues include team formation, team-to-task assignment, agent-to-work-position assignment and trajectory optimisation with collision avoidance. The problem becomes even more complicated when involving heterogeneous agents, tasks’ minimum requirements and fair allocation. This paper formulates all the combined issues as an optimisation problem and then proposes an integrated framework that addresses the problem in a decentralised fashion. We approximate and decouple the complex original problem into three subproblems (i.e. coalition formation, position allocation and path planning), which are sequentially addressed by three different proposed modules. The coalition formation module based on game theories deals with a max-min problem, the objective of which is to partition the agents into disjoint task-specific teams in a way that balances the agents’ work resources in proportion to the task’s minimum workload requirements. For agents assigned to the same task, given reasonable assumptions, the position allocation subproblem can be efficiently addressed in terms of computational complexity. For the trajectory optimisation, we utilise a Model Predictive Control and Sequential Convex Programming algorithm, which reduces the size of the problem so that the agents can generate collision-free trajectories on a real-time basis. As a proof of concept, we implement the framework into an unmanned aerial vehicle swarm’s cooperative stand-in jamming mission scenario and show its feasibility, fault tolerance and near-optimality based on numerical experiment. © IMechE 2018.

TI  - Geocaching-inspired Resilient Path Planning for Drone Swarms
AU  - Barbeau, Michel

AB  - A path planning algorithm for drone swarms is presented. From the outset, none of the drones knows the path and final destination. Together, they collectively determine and unravel step-by-step the waypoints and final destination, resolving a localization problem at each step. It is a shared-information path planning algorithm. The algorithm is fault-tolerant and resilient to drones falling victim of attacks to their positioning system. It is shown that correctly functioning drones navigate the path provided that the number of faulty drones is less than \fracn-d2, where n is the total number of drones and d, equal to two or three, is the dimension of the space navigated by the drones. We validate the algorithm with appropriate simulations, implemented over OMNeT++ and GNSSim, which allow building network simulations including GPS attacks (e.g., jamming and spoofing attacks). The OMNeT++ models and GNSSim functions are linked together. © 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Locating multiple GPS jammers using networked UAVs
AU  - Bhamidipati, Sriramya

T2  - IEEE Internet of Things Journal
AB  - Recent technologies, such as, Internet of Things and cloud services, increases the usage of small and low-cost networked unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which needs to be robust against malicious global positioning system (GPS) attacks. Due to the availability of low-cost GPS jammers in the commercial market, there has been a rising risk of multiple jammers and not just one. However, it is challenging to locate multiple jammers because the traditional jammer localization via multilateration is applicable for only a single jammer case. Also, during a jamming attack, the positioning capability of an on-board GPS receiver is compromised given its inability to track GPS signals. We propose a simultaneous localization of multiple jammers and receivers (SLMR) algorithm by analyzing the variation in the front-end signal power recorded by the GPS receivers on-board a network of UAVs. Our algorithm not only locates multiple jammers but also utilizes these malicious sources as additional navigation signals for positioning the UAVs. We design a Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density filter over a graph framework, which is optimized using a Levenberg-Marquardt minimizer. Using a simulated experimental setup, we validate the convergence and localization accuracy of our SLMR algorithm for various cases, including attacks with a single jammer, multiple jammers, and a varying number of jammers. We also demonstrate that our SLMR algorithm is able to simultaneously locate multiple jammers and UAVs, even for a larger transmitted power of the jammers. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - This paper studies the physical layer security of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network, where a UAV base station (UAV-B) transmits confidential information to multiple information receivers (IRs) with the aid of a UAV jammer (UAV-J) in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We formulate an optimization problem to jointly design the trajectories and transmit power of UAV-B and UAV-J in order to maximize the minimum average secrecy rate over all IRs. The optimization problem is non-convex and the optimization variables are coupled, which leads to the optimization problem being mathematically intractable. As such, we decompose the optimization problem into two subproblems and then solve it by employing an alternating iterative algorithm and the successive convex approximation technique. Our results show that the average secrecy rate performance of the proposed scheme provides about 20% and 150% performance gains over the joint trajectory and transmit power optimization without UAV-J scheme and the transmit power optimization with fixed trajectory scheme at flight period T=150 s, respectively. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, physical layer security is considered for cognitive radio networks using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled jamming noise. In the studied model, a secondary transmitter sends confidential messages to a secondary receiver in the presence of an external eavesdropper (Eve), and the UAV acts as a friendly jammer that degrades the decoding capability of Eve. Therefore, resource allocation in such a network must jointly optimize the transmission power and UAV's trajectory to maximize the secrecy rate, while satisfying a given interference threshold at the primary receiver. The design problem is non-convex, and thus, global optimality is difficult to obtain. Aiming to solve this problem, we first transform it into a more tractable form, and then propose a successive convex approximation-based algorithm for its solutions. The proposed algorithm has a low computational complexity and is guaranteed to obtain at least a locally optimal solution of the original problem. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design, compared to the existing ones. © 2019 IEEE.

TI  - Non-Iterative MDS Method for Collaborative Network Localization With Sparse Range and Pointing Measurements
AU  - Hamaoui, Moshe
T2  - IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing
AB  - Multi-agent localization is a basic requirement for many networked applications. The particular application to swarming unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or munitions requires spatial coordination of agents, including the ability to assume and maintain a prescribed flight formation. An in-flight awareness of network morphology and node location is therefore needed. While global navigation satellite systems offer an attractive solution, signal occlusion, spoofing, and jamming present unacceptable vulnerabilities - particularly for mission-critical operations. Alternative network localization methods using inter-agent radio frequency ranging and Angle of Arrival have been well studied over the past 15 years, but existing algorithms are not well suited to fast-moving networks. Iterative methods tend to converge slowly. Faster noniterative multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) methods for range, bearing, or vector measurements have also been formulated. However, these MDS methods generally require the full pairwise inter-agent measurement matrix - placing a severe requirement on swarm connectivity and leading to low tolerance for missing or badly estimated measurements. Even vector-based MDS, which incorporates both range and direction constraints, is shown here to require 4-vertex connectivity to achieve perfect localization. Results from rigidity theory, however, suggest that a lower connectivity threshold should be sufficient to guarantee a unique configuration (up to translation and rotation). In contrast, our proposed 'vertex resequencing' and 'edge resequencing' techniques further lower the vertex-connectivity threshold to 3 and 2, respectively. These localization techniques, which extend vector-based MDS with Nyström approximation, prescribe a graph-based kernel sampling scheme and weighted coordinate reconstruction that suppress the effect of missing measurements. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - GAUSS (Galileo-EGNOS as an Asset for UTM Safety and Security) is a H2020 project<sup>1</sup> that aims at designing and developing high performance positioning systems for drones within the U-Space framework focusing on UAS (Unmanned Aircraft System) VLL (Very Low Level) operations. The key element within GAUSS is the integration and exploitation of Galileo and EGNOS exceptional features in terms of accuracy, integrity and security, which will be key assets for the safety of current and future drone operations. More concretely, high accuracy, authentication, precise timing (among others) are key GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) enablers of future integrated drone operations under UTM (UAS Traffic Management) operations, which in Europe will be deployed under U-Space [1]. The U-Space concept helps control, manage and integrate all UAS in the VLL airspace to ensure the security and efficiency of UAS operations. GAUSS will enable not only safe, timely and efficient operations but also coordination among a higher number of RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft System) in the air with the appropriate levels of security, as it will improve anti-jamming and anti-spoofing capabilities through a multi-frequency and multi-constellation approach and Galileo authentication operations. The GAUSS system will be validated with two field trials in two different UTM real scenarios (inland and sea) with the operation of a minimum of four UTM coordinated UAS from different types (fixed and rotary wing), manoeuvrability and EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) operational categories. The outcome of the project will consist of Galileo-EGNOS based technological solutions to enhance safety and security levels in both, current UAS and future UTM operations. Increased levels of efficiency, reliability, safety, and security in UAS operations are key enabling features to foster the EU UAS regulation, market development and full acceptance by the society. © 2019 FGM Events LLC.

TI  - Hybrid AI as a defence against cyber-interference of military satellites
AU  - Ellery, Alex A.
AB  - The military satellite fleet is the backbone of the modern battlefield - it provides communications, navigation, weather forecasts, strategic intelligence, telemedicine and, potentially in the future, logistic supply in the field (through internet-of-things and perhaps in-situ 3D printing). It is also the backbone of the drone's capability to project power remotely without endangering friendly forces. The drone of course has become the cause celebre of recent revolutionary military affairs (RMA) in networked warfare. Traditional threats to satellites imposed technological barriers to entry to space warfare - anti-satellite missiles, hunter-killer interceptors, stealth cubesats, etc. The cyber-attack imposes no such barriers representing an asymmetric threat from any non-state aggressor against a crucial military technological infrastructure. Cyber-attacks may impose simple denial-of-service, convert the satellite into a source of SIGINT, cause expensive mission failure (e.g. Stuxnet on reaction wheels) or physical destruction (e.g. ignition of propellant or batteries), subvert satellite channels to broadcast propaganda (e.g. Tamil Tigers hacking Intelsat in 2007) or infect all recipients with malware, re-direct drones to friendly targets (e.g. South Korean reconnaissance drone crash into ground control station by North Korean jamming of its GPS signal), etc, many of which may be disguised as accidents. Stuxnet has demonstrated that computer viruses are a form of munitions. A multi-layered immunisation strategy is required. We propose isolating the spacecraft from the TTC uplink by imposing a high degree of Bayesian network-based artificial intelligence implemented on FPGA-based hardware neural network circuitry. The key to this capability is the mapping of Bayesian networks onto neural networks. There are several ways to achieve this but deep learning neural networks offer a potential solution. In neural network form, the AI is immune to logic bombs as there is no software code logic as it is distributed through the neural network. Neural network implementation on FPGA platforms ensures that no software can be uploaded without full prior access to the AI code. Although this is a radical solution, it may be the only means to harden military satellites against cyber-threats. © © 2019 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF). All rights reserved.

TI  - Measurement characterization for localizing multiple rfi sources simultaneously from a UAS
AU  - Perkins, Adrien

AU  - Powell, J. David
AB  - To combat the threat posed by jammers, a UAS based system has been developed to be able to rapidly localize the source of GPS interferers. Previously, the focus of the project, an unmanned aerial system (UAS) known as JAGER, has been on the development of a system capable of localizing a single static radio frequency interference (RFI) source [1]. JAGER is a UAS comprised of three main systems: the sensor to measure the bearing to the interference source, the localization system responsible for estimating the source location, and a path planning system to fly the vehicle in a way to minimize the cost of localization (typically thought of as the time to localize a source within a threshold) [2]. This works presents an analysis of the capabilities of the sensor, a phased array antenna, in an environment with multiple RFI sources. Understanding the sensor capabilities is key to being able to choose the right approach for localization and path planning. The introduction of additional interference sources poses a key challenge on the sensor’s ability to detect and measure the bearing to multiple sources simultaneously from a single receive signal strength (RSS) pattern. This paper presents a characterization and theoretical analysis of the performance of a 3-, 7-, and 19-element array in an environment with multiple interference sources. The difference in beamwidths of the different array sizes and side lobe suppression result in biases in the bearing measurements for the smaller arrays, while the larger arrays come at additional size, weight, and monetary costs, creating a set of tradeoffs to be considered for a system to localize multiple RFI sources from a UAS. To detect multiple sources, JAGER uses an onboard beam steering antenna to generate an RSS pattern (by measuring signal strength). For each RSS pattern, the bearing to each of the lobes detected is determined using the 3dB method used for bearing determination to a single source [3]. The theoretical performance of this method is evaluated in two different simulated multi-source environments. Finally, some design constraints are presented for the bearing sensor for detecting multiple sources based on the desired angular separation capabilities. © ION 2019.All right reserved.

AB  - An unmanned aerial system (UAS) based system has been developed to be able to rapidly localize the source of GNSS interference to minimize the impact interference would have on critical infrastructure, such as an airport. Previously, the project, known as Jammer Acquisition with GPS Exploration and Reconnaissance or JAGER, has demonstrated capabilities of localizing a signal source in real time by physically rotating the antenna, however this approach proved to be a slow approach to localization [1]. Since that demonstration, the sensor has been upgraded to be electronically steered, the localizing algorithm and path planning has been improved to account for the higher rate of bearing measurements, and a GNSS independent navigation system has been developed. Each of these pieces have been demonstrated individually in both flight tests and simulation, however, until now, the full system has not been operated together in real-time [2]-[4]. This paper presents the real-time implementation of all the core sub-systems making up the JAGER platform working together to localizing a signal source in a GNSS denied environment. The JAGER system is made up of three sub-systems: the interference localization system, a GNSS denied navigation system, and a path planning system. The interference localization system is comprised of an electronically beam steered antenna making signal strength measurements to create received signal strength (RSS) patterns from which bearing information can be used to estimate the RFI source location. The GNSS denied navigation system is built around using optical flow from a gimbal stabilized FLIR Systems Boson infrared (IR) camera to measure velocity and in turn estimate the position of the vehicle. Finally, the path planning system sends velocity commands to the autopilot to fly a desired trajectory to get the best bearing measurements for estimating the RFI source. Flight tests were performed at Edwards Air Force Base with a 2W, 5MHz wide, 2.48 GHz signal source being localized by JAGER. The GNSS denied environment was created in software by disabling the use of GNSS by the autopilot for real time guidance and control. The flight tests were conducted at night, in the early morning (pre-sunrise), and in the late morning to stress test the IR based vision system and demonstrate the capabilities in a range of time periods. The location chosen at Edwards Air Force Base also consisted of a large hangar door that presented “urban environment”-like challenges (namely reflections of the signal source). The flight tests comprised of 35 different mission attempts, where a mission consists of starting from a known location and fully autonomously executing the localization of the signal source with no user interaction until the source was determined to be localized. Of the 35 different mission attempts, 16 successfully localized the signal source with an average final 2D localization error of 13m, and the vision system demonstrated a drift rate of 4% and 6.1% during the day and night, respectively. © 2019, Institute of Navigation.

AB  - Positioning information plays a significant role in multiunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) applications. Traditionally, the positioning information is widely provided by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) due to its good performance and global coverage. However, owing to complicated flight environment or signal blockage, jamming and unintentional interference, the UAVs may fail to locate themselves by using GNSS alone. As a new method to resolve these problems, cooperative positioning, by incorporating peer-to-peer range measurements and assisted information, has attracted more and more attentions due to its ability to enhance the accuracy and availability of positioning. However, achieving good performance of cooperative positioning of multi-UAVs is challenging as their mobility, arbitrary nonlinear state-evolution, measurement models and limited computation and communication resources. In this paper, we present a factor graph (FG) representation and message passing methodology to solve cooperative positioning problem among UAVs in 3-dimensional environment where GNSS cannot provide services. Moreover, to deal with the nonlinear state-evolution and measurement models while decreasing the computation complexity and communication cost, we develop a distributed algorithm for dynamic and hybrid UAVs by means of Spherical-Radial Cubature Rules (CR) method with belief propagation (BP) and variational message passing (VMP) methods (CRBP-VMP) on the FG. The proposed CRBP deals with the highly non-linear state-evolution models and non-Gaussian distributions, the VMP method is employed for ranging message, gets the simpler message representation and can reduce communication cost in the joint estimation problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the higher positioning accuracy, the better convergence as well as low computational complexity and communication cost of the proposed CRBP-VMP algorithm, which can be achieved compared with sum–product algorithm over a wireless network (SPAWN) and traditional Cubature Kalman Filters (CKF) method. © © 2019 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication has drawn rising interest recently with the distinctive gains brought by its inherent mobility. In this paper, we investigate the throughput maximization problem in UAV-enabled uplink communication, where multiple ground nodes communicate with a UAV while a group of ground jammers send jamming signals to jam the communications between UAV and the ground nodes. In contrast to the previous works that only considering UAV’s transmit power allocation and two-dimension (2D) trajectory design, the ground nodes’ transmit power allocation and scheduling along with the UAV’s three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design are jointly optimized. The formulated throughput maximization problem is a mixed-integer non-convex programme that hard to be solved in general. Thus, we propose an iterative algorithm to make the problem trackable by applying the block coordinate descent and successive convex optimization techniques. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark methods that improving the throughput of the system significantly. © © 2019 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers

AB  - This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled secure transmission systems, where a source UAV (SUAV) intends to send confidential signals to the legitimate user in the presence of a potential eavesdropper. To improve the system’s secrecy rate, a jamming UAV (JUAV) is leveraged to cooperatively send interference signals to the potential eavesdropper. By taking into account the limited energy budget of UAV, our goal is to maximize the system secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), namely the achievable secrecy rate per energy consumption unit, by jointly optimizing UAV trajectory and transmit power under the constraints of UAV mobility as well as the maximum transmit power. The formulated problem is shown to be a non-convex fractional optimization problem, which is challenging to solve. To this end, we decompose the original problem into two sub-problems, and then an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed by leveraging block coordinate descent and Dinkelbach method in combination with successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms other benchmarks significantly in terms of the system SEE. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication has attracted increasing attention recently, benefiting from its high mobility. However, most existing studies concentrate on a perfect scenario, without considering the unintentional interference/intentional jamming and uncertain channel/location information. In addition, the UAV-to-UAV (U2U) communication scenario has not been widely investigated as the UAV-to-Ground case. To fill this gap, this paper investigates the robust U2U communications in the presence of jamming, where the U2U communication channel and jammer location are considered to be uncertain, i.e., only having partial information. For the non-convex optimization with the aim of minimizing the flight time, we propose a successive convex approximation method by introducing S-procedure and slack variables. The inner optimization is transformed into a semidefinite programming problem, which can be optimally solved by standard convex techniques. Simulation results validate the proposed path planning method in the presence of jamming. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

In this paper, we investigate the optimization of the UAV flight path in a wireless relay communication system, when a jamming or interference signal is present. The UAV flight path is optimized to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), and the required parameters are estimated. The simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve performance close to an ideal SINR optimization and also highlight the benefits of optimizing the SINR instead of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when a jamming or interference signal is present. © 2013 IEEE.

TI  - PSO algorithm for UAV autonomous path planning with threat and energy cost optimization
AU  - Konatowski, S.
AU  - Pawłowski, Piotr
AB  - The PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) algorithm uses a population of single particles, randomly distributed over the function search space, in order to construct an optimal flight path. During the algorithm iteration execution, each particle evaluates its fitness function according to the actual position. Then, every particle moves towards a direction dependent on its actual best position and the position of the best particle so far. The procedure ends when the iteration limit is reached or fitness criterium is met. In the presented autonomous UAV 3D path planning method, a PSO algorithm is used to build a feasible path, optimized in terms of fuel and threat cost. The process begins when the UAV detects or receives information about threats appearing on its primary trajectory. The population of particles moves in the search space of three variables, which are the angles of pitch, roll and yaw. These angles determine the spatial orientation of the UAV, indicating its direction of movement in each step. Further waypoints are chosen with consideration of the distance to the target and violation of threat areas. As a final result, the PSO algorithm constructs a suboptimal, feasible path which could be used as a reference trajectory for the UAV's automatic control system. Simulation results turned out to be completely repeatable and indistinguishable, despite the stochastic nature of the algorithm, which proves its great optimization abilities. Moreover, its short execution time (within seconds) allows this procedure to be used in real time applications. © 2019 SPIE.

AB  - Simulative generation of images that would be registered by a photo camera installed on board UAV is a complex process, consisting of a number of geometric transformations and image processing operations. The article presents a method of creating such images based on the assumed UAV navigation parameters, i.e. geographical coordinates, altitude and angles of orientation. The operation of the proposed simulator is based on the use of equations related to the geometry of the perspective photo and the principle of operation of a digital camera. The simulator may be used as a generator of testing images, especially for research works related to creating and developing algorithms for vision-based navigation. It allows to simulate and save images for the whole preprogrammed flight trajectory. It supports also creating robust algorithms for processing erroneous data from integrated navigation systems. Comparing images obtained from an onboard camera with their simulated counterparts allows to determine synchronization errors, which is important for the appropriate operation of a vision-based navigation system. © 2019 SPIE.

AB  - Redundant navigation systems are critical for safe operation of UAVs in high-risk environments. Since most commercial UAVs almost wholly rely on GPS, jamming, interference, and multi-pathing are real concerns that usually limit their operations to low-risk environments and visual line-of-sight. This letter presents a vision-based route-following system for the autonomous, safe return of UAVs under primary navigation failure such as GPS jamming. Using a Visual Teach and Repeat framework to build a visual map of the environment during an outbound flight, we show the autonomous return of the UAV by visually localizing the live view to this map when a simulated GPS failure occurs, controlling the vehicle to follow the safe outbound path back to the launch point. Using gimbal-stabilized stereo vision and inertial sensing alone, without reliance on external infrastructure, Visual Odometry and localization are achieved at altitudes of 5-25 m and flight speeds up to 55 km/h. We examine the performance of the visual localization algorithm under a variety of conditions and also demonstrate closed-loop autonomy along a complicated 450 m path. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Muti-UAV System has the characteristics of complex system, and its survivability is affected by location dependability. Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) is usually used by low-cost cooperative Multi-UAV system, which is easily being cheated when there are some GPS jammers, especially when there is a deception GPS jammer. Meanwhile Multi-UAV system can improve the responsibility of location by communication, which is also easily being disturbed and cheated. Aiming at the location safety problem of multi-UAV system under deceitful and interferential environment, a new Tri-Layer Trust Model (TLTM) has been established in this paper. In view of the characteristic of multi-UAV's cooperation, there is transaction layer, rating layer and communication layer in TLTM. The trust model can be computed through information of demander, tenderer and the third party. Meanwhile, the best cooperated partner will be selected through the results. The introducing of communication layer simulates the real condition of UAV system under deceitful and interferential information. When there is GPS jammer and communication jamming, it can also provide a safety decision method for multi-UAV system. Simulation results verify that this method could afford a reliable mean of location under deceitful and interferential environment. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled secure communication systems where a mobile UAV wishes to send confidential messages to multiple ground users. To improve the security performance, a cooperative UAV is additionally considered that transmits the jamming signal. In this system, we maximize the minimum secrecy rate among the ground users by jointly optimizing the trajectory and the transmit power of the UAVs as well as the user scheduling. To efficiently solve this nonconvex problem, we adopt block successive upper bound minimization techniques, which address a sequence of approximated convex problems for each block of variables. Numerical results verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline methods. © 1967-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The knowledge of spatial distributions of physical quantities, such as radio-frequency (RF) interference, pollution, geomagnetic field magnitude, temperature, humidity, audio, and light intensity, will foster the development of new context-aware applications. For example, knowing the distribution of RF interference might significantly improve cognitive radio systems [1], [2]. Similarly, knowing the spatial variations of the geomagnetic field could support autonomous navigation of robots (including drones) in factories and/or hazardous scenarios [3]. Other examples are related to the estimation of temperature gradients, detection of sources of RF signals, or percentages of certain chemical components. As a result, people could get personalized health-related information based on their exposure to sources of risks (e.g., chemical or pollution). We refer to these spatial distributions of physical quantities as spatial fields. All of the aforementioned examples have in common that learning the spatial fields requires a large number of sensors (agents) surveying the area [4], [5]. © 1991-2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure communication system. Two UAVs are applied in this system where one UAV moves around to communicate with multiple users on the ground using orthogonal time-division multiple access while the other UAV in the area jams the eavesdroppers on the ground to protect communications of the desired users. Specifically, we maximize the minimum worst-case secrecy rate among the users within each period by jointly adjusting UAV trajectories and user scheduling under the maximum UAV speed constraints, the UAV return constraints, the UAV collision avoidance constraints, and the discrete binary constraints on user scheduling variables. Since the resulting optimization problem is very difficult to solve due to its highly nonlinear objective function and nonconvex constraints, we first equivalently transform it into a more tractable problem. In particular, the binary constraints are equivalently converted to a number of equality constraints. Then, we develop a novel joint optimization algorithm to handle the converted problem. In order to further improve the secrecy rate performance, we also extend the developed algorithm to the case with multiple jamming UAVs. The simulation results show that the proposed joint optimization algorithm achieves significantly better performance than the conventional algorithms. © 1983-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) such as GPS are the de-facto standard for absolute and reliable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) localization due to their global availability and the maturity and wide spread of the underlying technology. However, as the spread and reliance upon autonomous UAV systems increases, the risk of jamming becomes a substantial safety problem. The area where jamming attacks are most likely to occur is the close vicinity of the UAV landing station. Hence, to ensure reliable operations, an alternative localization technology for the approach and landing phase is needed. This paper presents a localization system for 3D position estimation based on 24 GHz FMCW cooperative radar. It has very low infrastructure requirements thanks to the combination of ranging and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation techniques employed in the ground station. Jamming resistance is improved due to the large bandwidth of 250 MHz. A measurement campaign was conducted to prove the feasibility of the proposed concept. © 2018 IEEE.

Specifically, we maximize the minimum average secrecy rate among the users within each period by jointly optimizing UAV trajectories and user scheduling variables under the maximum UAV speed constraints, the UAV return constraints, and the discrete binary constraints on user scheduling variables. The resulting optimization problem is very challenging due to its highly nonconvex objective function and constraints. We then develop a novel algorithm based on the penalty concave-convex procedure (CCCP) technique to solve it.

AB  - Lately, a rising number of incidents between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and planes have been reported in airports and airfields. In order to help cope with this problem, in this paper we evaluated the use of low cost SDR platforms (Software Defined Radio) for the implementation of a jammer able to generate an effective interfering signal aimed at the GPS navigation system. Using a programmable BladeRF x40 platform from Nuand and the GNU Radio software development toolkit, several interference techniques were studied and evaluated, considering the spectral efficiency, energy efficiency and complexity. It was shown that the tested approaches are capable of stopping the reception of the radionavigation signal in real-life scenarios, neutralizing the capacity for autonomous operation of the vehicle. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we consider an anti-jamming problem for one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) reaching a given destination with maintaining the communication quality, where the ground-to-air communication link is spatially affected by an adversarial jammer. Note that the jammer's position and transmit power are initially unknown. To solve this problem, we propose a jammer detection-localization-evasion framework. Firstly, we employ a jammer detection method combining the Received Signal Strength (RSS) with Packet Error Rate (PER). After the jammer is detected, our designed RSS based jammer localization algorithm is presented, which can estimate the jammer position and jamming signal power simultaneously. However, localization noises often exist in practical scenarios, and therefore the estimated jammer information is usually with uncertainties. To overcome these uncertainties, we propose a robust path planning method of successful jammer evasion. More specifically, the proposed method can guarantee the worst-case performance so that the communication quality can be always better than a certain level under all possible uncertainties. Finally, a UAV communication jammed model is built on Network Simulator (NS3) and corroborates the effectiveness of our proposed method. © 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Visual GPS-denied multi-agent localization & terrain classification
AU  - Chiel, Benjamin S.

AB  - This paper furthers the state of the art of visual localization by harnessing recently developed scene recognition and understanding machine learning (ML) algorithms to rethink how vision can be used for navigation, particularly when combined with a realistic, minimalist, and robust multi-agent approach. The focus on visual navigation comes as GPS is increasingly unreliable (jammed, spoofed, or disabled), or unavailable (indoor, or extraterrestrial environments). GPS denial/unreliability is an area of active research in general, with unmanned parafoil systems being one UAV application. The landing locations for parafoil systems must be pre-programmed manually with global coordinates, which may be inaccurate or outdated, and offer no in-flight adaptability. This paper will introduce a novel and minimalist approach to visual navigation and multi-agent communication using semantic machine learning classification and geometric constraints. This approach enables localization and landing site identification for multiple communicating UAV systems deployed in GPS-denied environments. This is a capability extending beyond singleagent localization, as well as a novel landing site classification approach. A mathematical foundation using information theory provides the technical grounding for the algorithms presented, and simulation results demonstrate how multiple agents using the proposed algorithms make a significant improvement in localization accuracy and speed over a single agent. Desirable landing sites for UAVs generally, and autonomous parafoils in particular, constitute locations where payload survivability and accessibility are greatest. An on-board semantic representation and understanding of the operating environment will allow systems to automatically detect and classify these desirable and undesirable landing sites, enabling successful landing in a much larger class of scenarios than currently possible, in addition to a fail-safe capability when localization is not feasible. This paper will further introduce an algorithm enabling multiple agents to reproduce this classification of their environment on-line better and more rapidly than a single agent working alone, demonstrating the advantage of multiple agents in this context as well. This has applications to general UAV landing, whether powered or unpowered, on Earth or in extra-terrestrial environments. © 2018 IEEE.

TI  - Phased array radio system aided inertial navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles
AU  - Albrektsen, Sigurd Mørkved
AU  - Bryne, Torleiv Haland
AU  - Johansen, Tor Arne
AB  - Two of the major challenges with beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) operations for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) today are navigation and communication. This paper presents a solution that takes on both problems simultaneously, using a phased array radio system (PARS) both for communication and to aid a micro-electro-mechanical inertial navigation system (INS), estimating position, velocity and attitude. The solution is independent of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) for positioning and highly resistant to malicious sources, such as spoofing and jamming. The state estimator presented in this paper fuses range and bearing measurements from the PARS with the measurements from an on-board inertial measurement unit, a magnetometer and a barometer. By aiding the INS with PARS position measurements, magnetometer readings and barometric measurements, drift-free PVA estimates are obtained. The PARS measurements can be used for navigation alongside today's GNSS solutions, or as a redundant backup system running in parallel. To validate the observer, an experiment was carried out with a fixed wing UAV on an approximately 35 minute flight with a maximal distance of 5.35 km from the base station. During this flight a root-mean-square accuracy of 26.3 m compared to a real-time kinematic GNSS solution was achieved. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The localization of a radio-frequency transmitter with intermittent transmissions is considered via a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with omnidirectional received signal strength sensors. This group embarks on an autonomous patrol to localize and track the target with a specified accuracy, as quickly as possible. The challenge can be decomposed into two stages: 1) estimation of the target position given previous measurements (localization) and 2) planning the future trajectory of the tracking UAVs to get lower expected localization error given current estimation (path planning). For each stage, we compare two algorithms in terms of performance and computational load. For the localization stage, we compare a detection-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a recursive Bayesian estimator. For the path planning stage, we compare a steepest descent posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound path planning and a bioinspired heuristic path planning. Our results show that the steepest descent path planning outperforms the bioinspired path planning by an order of magnitude, and recursive Bayesian estimator narrowly outperforms detection-based EKF. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - During sudden anti-terrorist drives conducted by the security personnel and law enforcement units in a certain region, a localized cyber security system happens to be a special tactic to avert the unprecedented massacre and gruesome fatalities against the residents of that area by disconnecting the affected territory from the rest of the world; so that the militants and their outside accomplices cannot communicate with each other and also the terrorists cannot go through the ongoing apprehensive operation via Internet or Mobile communication. This paper presents a novel framework of an unmanned aerial vehicular networking signal jammer which is oriented to block incoming and outgoing signals of all frequencies transmitted from a specifically marginalized territory scanned and explored by the aerial vehicle. During such a cyber-vigilance operation, the aerial vehicle is equipped with a transmitter and an auto-tuning band-pass filter module with automatic regulation of center frequencies according to the surrounding networking signals, which are considered to be the suppressing noise parameters. In order to restrict the signal blocking operation within the militant hub, the aerial vehicle with the network terminator is controlled to navigate within a particular boundary of a residential area and its navigation is continuously mapped and stored for effective evacuation process directed to save the innocent stranded people. The implemented system is tested in certain practical arenas with particular dimensions for assessing the aerial exploration of the vehicle. The test arenas are provided with signals of different frequencies along with variation in dimensions of the testing environment to affirm the reliability and sustainability of the aerial vehicular auto-tuning signal jammer. © 2017 IEEE.

AU  - Zammit, Christian
AU  - van Kampen, E. Jan
AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are being integrated into a wide range of indoor and outdoor applications. In this light, robust and efficient path planning is paramount. An extensive literature review showed that the A* and Rapidly Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithms and their variants are the most promising path planning algorithms candidates for 3D UAV scenarios. These two algorithms are tested in different complexity 3D scenarios consisting of a box and a combination of vertical and horizontal plane obstacles with apertures. The path length and generation time are considered as the performance measures. The A* with a spectrum of resolutions, the standard RRT with different step size constraints, RRT without step size constraints and the Multiple RRT (MRRT) with various seeds are implemented and their performance measures compared. Results confirm that all algorithms are able to generate a path in all scenarios for all resolutions, step sizes and seeds considered, respectively. Overall A*‘s path length is more optimal and generation time is shorter than RRT projecting A* as a better candidate for online 3D path planning of UAVs. © 2018 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

TI  - From shipboard landing to aerial refueling: Autonomous relative navigation
AU  - Moafipoor, Shahram

AU  - Fayman, Jeffrey A.
AB  - In this paper, we present experimental results of a relative navigation system developed to support autonomous relative navigation of manned and unmanned UAVs in demanding applications such as aerial refueling and autonomous landing. What is common to these applications is the interaction between two or more vehicles. We refer to two vehicles as Primary and Secondary depending on where the relative navigation calculations are performed. Relative navigation is provided between a single Primary unit and multiple Secondary units. The core of the GPS/IMU based system is an Extended Relative Navigation Filter, Rel-EKF, that is updated by the relative position vector provided by the GPS moving baseline ambiguity fixing technique. In the system, raw observations from the GPS and IMU of the Secondary are transmitted to the Primary through a datalink. The Primary uses this data to determine its Relative Position, Navigation, Time (PNT) to the Secondary. From a generic perspective, the system can utilize relative distance/attitude measurements from any non-GPS-based sources to update the Rel-EKF and calibrate relative navigation equations. Autonomous operations require that the total system error over a specific time interval be provided at the desired accuracy with a probability of 0.95%. Experiments began by validating system accuracy as a function of sensor configuration. Ground tests were conducted with different IMU’s grades and several configurations of GPS including civilian and SAASM sensors. Following performance analysis, we tested the system for use in shipboard landing and aerial refueling applications on UAV flights. Total system error and risk allocation analyses were performed for the data collected. The relative position, velocity, and attitude accuracy, under normal conditions, were expected to be at an accuracy of 0.25m,0.1m/s, and 0.5°, respectively. Future developments of the system include assured system integrity under GPS-denied conditions, including jamming and spoofing. © 2018 Institute of Navigation. All rights reserved.

T2  - Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems
AB  - During sudden anti-terrorist drives conducted by the law enforcement agencies, a localized cyber security system happens to be a special tactic to avert the unprecedented massacre and gruesome fatalities against the residents of that area by disconnecting the affected territory from the rest of the world; so that the militants and their outside accomplices cannot communicate with each other and also the terrorists cannot go through the ongoing apprehensive operation via wireless communications. This paper presents a novel framework of an unmanned aerial vehicular networking signal jammer which is oriented to block incoming and outgoing signals of all frequencies transmitted from a specifically marginalized territory scanned and explored by the aerial vehicle. During such a cyber-vigilance operation, the aerial vehicle is equipped with a transmitter and an auto-tuning band-pass filter module with automatic regulation of center frequencies according to the surrounding networking signals, which are considered to be the suppressing noise parameters. In order to restrict the signal blocking operation within the militant hub, the aerial vehicle with the network terminator is controlled to navigate within a particular boundary of a residential area and its navigation is continuously mapped and stored for effective evacuation process directed to save the innocent stranded people. A very low frequency (VLF) metal detector has been designed to trace the explosives and buried landmines inside the exploration arena. An algorithm for 3-D mapping of the metal traces detected by the aerial navigator has been presented in this paper. Signal blocking, metal tracing and stable confined movements have been tested where the testbed is provided with signals of different frequencies along with variation in dimensions of the testing region to evaluate the reliability of the proposed framework. © 2018 Advances in Science, Technology and Engineering Systems.All right reserved.

AB  - In order to realize an UAV formation cluster system based on the current GPS and the fault and insufficiency of Beidou integrated navigation system in strong jamming environment, Due to the impact of the compass on the plane crash, navigation system error caused by the mobile area to help reduce the need for large landing sites and not in the small fast moving area to achieve the reality of the landing. By using Strapdown inertial and all-optical system to form Composite UAV flight control system, the photoelectric composite strapdown inertial coupling is realized, and through the laser and microwave telemetry link compound communication mechanism, using all-optical strapdown inertial and visual navigation system to solve the deviation of take-off and landing caused by electromagnetic interference, all-optical bidirectional data link realizes two-way position correction of landing site and aircraft, thus achieves the accurate recovery of UAV formation cluster in the mobile narrow area which the traditional navigation system can't realize. This system is a set of efficient unmanned aerial vehicle Group Take-off/descending system, which is suitable for many tasks, and not only realizes the reliable continuous navigation under the complex electromagnetic interference environment, moreover, the intelligent flight and Take-off and landing of unmanned aerial vehicles relative to the fast moving and small recovery sites in complex electromagnetic interference environment can not only improve the safe operation rate of unmanned aerial vehicle, but also guarantee the operation safety of the aircraft, and the more has important social value for the application foreground of the aircraft. © 2018 SPIE.

AB  - We are leaving in the world where rapid changes in technologies are taking place. The world is not the same what it was before 20 years. With new technologies every new day, mankind have achieved tremendous amount of dreams which were almost impossible few decades back. Automatic cars, auto navigating planes, goods delivering drones and many more are the dreams going to complete in near future. Navigation signals will play key role for the development of this technologies. At the same time a group of people having destructive mind have developed the jammer and spoofers which can affect the navigation signals. It worsens the navigation system. It may totally lose the navigation signals or may feed the wrong navigation signals to mislead the system. These things are being proved as a bigger challenge to the upcoming technologies. To fight with this enemy detailed study of jammers and spoofers are required. In this paper jammers are categorized using different ways to understand its signal property. After proper knowledge of these signals one can develop a system which will be immune to the jamming signals. Here, the classifications are done with the detail signal characteristics of jammer, are more beneficial to develop reinforce navigation signal receiver. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, a simulation model of digital intermediate frequency (IF) GPS signal is presented. This design is developed based on mathematical model representing the digitized IF GPS signal. In details, C/A code, navigation data and P code, and the noise models are configured some initial settings simultaneously. Simulation results show that the simulated signals share the same properties with real signals (e.g. C/A code correlation properties, and the spread spectrum). The simulated GPS IF signal data can work as input for various signal processing algorithm of GPS receivers, such as acquisition, tracking, carrier-to-noise ratio (C/No) estimation, and GPS spoofing signal generation. Particularly, the simulated GPS signal can conduct scenarios by adjust SNR values of the noise generator during simulation (e.g. signal outages, sudden changes of GPS signal power), which can be used as setup experiments of spoofing/jamming interference to UAVs for drone security applications. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The wide use of the Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation has been persistent for a long time. However, in today's scenario when technologies are advancing the accuracy of positioning systems, there are various new threats and challenges emerging. The signal receivers for positioning systems are prone to spoofing. This external interference in the system is usually done by feeding false signals to the receiver. Though the dead reckoning method is still in use, any interference with GPS can still lead to disaster. Insects and birds are known to use solar position for guidance and it is widely accepted by researchers that some birds, such as pigeons, use solar position in their homing flight. There are similar studies performed on honeybees and monarch butterflies. The use of solar position by these insects and birds brings up the question of whether a mathematical model can be used to replicate the results for aircraft navigation, and can a bio-inspired navigation algorithm like this be implemented? Solar position algorithms are already in wide use. The solar position algorithms available calculate the azimuth and zenith/incidence angles for the solar position at any given point of time when the position of the observer is known. The objective for navigation is to find an observer's position from solar position to present an alternative to GPS for navigational use. This document proposes a method for calculating the observer's position when the azimuth and zenith/incidence angles for solar position, attitude of aircraft and time are known. The approach proposed is that the position of the observer can be calculated by reversing the ENEA algorithm where instead of calculating the solar position using an observer's position, one will be calculating the position of the observer from solar position and time. The study includes the comparison of the calculated position of a UAS using the proposed method with the onboard GPS readings for both the ideal and the mimicked sensor accuracies for the position of the sun. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Small consumer unmanned aircraft systems (sUASs) have been involved in many security incidents recently. Current defense methods have serious limitations because they mostly try to physically capture an sUAS or jam its communications and its GPS signals to trigger its fail-safe features. While physical methods are usually unscalable and often slow in response, the default fail-safe features can be easily changed to other options such as continuing its pre-configured mission, regardless of jamming. Therefore, new defense solutions must be developed to address these issues. To our best knowledge, very little research has been published in this area. In this paper, we propose a false data injection attack to exploit the limitation of sensoring and processing capabilities on an sUAS and manipulate its on-board sensors, in order to deviate it from its (pre-configured) flight plan. We have analyzed the popular ArduPilot flight control system, identified potential vulnerabilities in its sensor data fusion process, and developed a method to manipulate on-board magnetometer readings while avoiding being detected by its bad-data detection schemes. Our initial results show that the proposed method is able to misguide the navigation system and deviate an sUAS from its target destination far away. While we present our main ideas in this paper, we are further investigating related theoretical issues and improving the proposed method with practical experimental tests. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, consumer-class UAVs have come into public view and cyber security starts to attract the attention of researchers and hackers. The tasks of positioning, navigation and return-to-home (RTH) of UAV heavily depend on GPS. However, the signal structure of civil GPS used by UAVs is completely open and unencrypted, and the signal received by ground devices is very weak. As a result, GPS signals are vulnerable to jamming and spoofing. The development of software define radio (SDR) has made GPS-spoofing easy and costless. GPS-spoofing may cause UAVs to be out of control or even hijacked. In this paper, we propose a novel method to detect GPS-spoofing based on monocular camera and IMU sensor of UAV. Our method was demonstrated on the UAV of DJI Phantom 4. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach for localising a GPS (Global Positioning System)-denied Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with the aid of a GPS-equipped UAV in three-dimensional space. The GPS-equipped UAV makes discrete-time broadcasts of its global coordinates. The GPS-denied UAV receives the broadcast and in doing so takes a direction of arrival (DOA) measurement towards the origin of the broadcast in its local coordinate frame (obtained via an inertial navigation system (INS)). The aim is to determine the difference between the local and global frames, described by a rotation and a translation. In the noiseless case, global coordinates are recovered exactly by solving a system of linear equations. When DOA measurements are contaminated with noise, rank relaxed semidefinite programming (SDP) and the Orthogonal Procrustes algorithm are employed. Simulations are provided and factors affecting accuracy, such as noise levels and number of measurements, are explored. © 2017

AB  - This article discusses the rendezvous maneuver for a fleet of small fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Trajectories have to be generated on-line while avoiding collision with static and dynamic obstacles and minimizing rendezvous time. An approach based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) is investigated which assures that the dynamic constraints of the UAVs are satisfied at every time step. By introducing binary variables, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem is formulated. Computation time is limited by incorporating the receding horizon technique. A shorter planning horizon strongly reduces computation time, but delays detection of obstacles which can lead to an infeasible path. The result is a robust path planning algorithm that satisfies the imposed constraints. However, further relaxation of the constraints and fine-tuning is necessary to limit complexity. © 2017

AB  - Simulation test beds serve as a cost-effective and safe way to evaluate the system performance of various real world systems. With the rising concerns in the security of sensitive and critical systems, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a software simulation test bed is clearly the best choice given that the environment and various system components are modeled correctly. This becomes critical given the recently developed autonomous aerial vehicles. We therefore evaluate several available simulation test beds and use the most promising test bed to analyze the impact of Global Positioning System (GPS)-related attacks on navigation of UAVs. We also introduce a novel technique for GPS spoofing, attack detection, and mitigation. This paper presents GPS spoofing and GPS jamming attacks with their anatomy, design, and impact evaluation on navigation as well as a novel GPS spoofing mitigation and detection technique for UAVs, using UAVSim: an open source simulation test bed. © 2017 The Author(s).

TI  - Attitude Determination of Multirotor Aerial Vehicles Using Camera Vector Measurements
AU  - Dos Santos, Davi Antônio

T2  - Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications
AB  - The employment of embedded cameras in navigation and guidance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) has attracted the focus of many academic researches. In particular, for the multirotor UAV, the camera is widely employed for applications performed in indoor environments, where the GNSS signal is often unreliable and electromagnetic interference can be a concern. In the literature, images are mostly adopted for position and velocity estimation, rather than attitude estimation. This paper proposes an attitude determination method for multirotor aerial vehicles using pairs of vector measurements taken from a downward-facing strapdown camera. The method is composed of three modules. The first one detects and identifies the visible landmarks by processing the images. The second module computes the vector measurements related to the direction from the camera to the landmarks. The third module estimates attitude from the vector measurements. In the last module, a version of the Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) with sequential update is proposed as estimation method. The overall method is evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations, showing that it is effective in determining the vehicle’s attitude and revealing its properties. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AU  - Li, Chang

AB  - Based on the analysis of GPS deception jamming theory, this paper considers the control feathers of the UAV GPS/INS integrated navigation system and designs an innovation detection rule for the UAV navigation system state estimation. Methods of direct track deception and track fusion are used to achieve the intrusive control of the navigation system and the control of the UAV's trajectory through the GPS deception jamming. The normalized innovation squared under two control modes is given through theoretical derivation and simulation analysis. The results show that the method of track fusion not only can realize the cheating of UAV trajectory, but also not easy to be checked, which provides an effective means of interference for GPS countermeasures. © 2016 IEEE.

TI  - Development of an autonomous flight controller for surveillance UAV
AU  - Hassan, Mahmood Ul
AU  - Ikram, Muhammad Ahmer
AU  - Shah, Syed Irtiza Ali
AB  - This paper presents the different stages of development of flight controller for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with autonomously flying capability. The main purpose of flight controller is to perform a petrol function between given GPS coordinates while maintaining a specified altitude for an assigned time and then return to its launching position without any human interaction. At first a simulated environment was designed to verify the concept. Then this was implemented on actual unmanned helicopter. In wake of the current political and security situation the need for autonomous UAVs and particularly the small scale helicopters are under consideration. However, hobby airframes used for normal radio controlled flying are not readily compatible with delicate, sophisticated and complex electronics. In addition to the hardware integration with such airframes, several other challenges such as electromagnetic interference, communication signal integrity from jammers and damping of strong vibrations were handled. The goal is to develop an autonomous UAV with self-controlled flying capabilities and above mentioned functionality. It should also fulfil the requirements to perform an adequate surveillance during any political and security situation. © 2016 IEEE.

TI  - Sensitivity of unmanned aerial vehicle model-aided navigation
AU  - D’Urso, Stéphane
AU  - Gross, Jason N.
AB  - To overcome the rapid and unbounded error growth of low-cost Inertial Navigation Systems (INS), aircraft localization methods commonly compensate for Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor errors by integrating them with Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements via a Kalman Filter. However, over the past decade, the potential of GPS jamming or even spoofing GPS signals has focused the research community on the development of GPS-denied navigation technologies. Of the GPS-denied techniques, one approach that has been considered is the use of a Vehicle Dynamic Models (VDM) to reduce the rate at which an INS becomes unusable. As such, this paper considers the use of an aerodynamic model to aid in compensation of IMU errors of a fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The goals of this paper are to evaluate the sensitivity of the performance of dynamic model aided navigation in the context of low-cost platforms where performance benefit must be weighed against the complexity that is required to develop the dynamic model. To do this, first, the sensitivity to the required modeling accuracy is shown by perturbing the model coefficients with errors. In addition, different sensors and sensor grades are evaluated, and three different model-aided navigation architectures are discussed and evaluated. To conduct this work, a UAV simulation is developed within which a UAV trajectory is driven by ’truth’ dynamic model and then IMU measurements are derived and errors are added to them using standard stochastic models for IMU sensors. In preparation for UAV flight tests, this performance sensitivity study is conducted to characterize the expected performance. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

AB  - Evolving global navigation satellite system (GNSS) threats are becoming a concern for all unmanned aerial systems (UAS) dependent upon GNSS aided navigation. More and more UAS platforms are considering integration of GNSS anti-jam (AJ) electronics and controlled radiation pattern antenna (CRPA) arrays to mitigate threats and ensure mission success. Due to restrictions and excessive costs for live-sky range testing, evaluation of these AJ systems requires specialized lab equipment and software to replicate the threats in dynamic environments. A test capability has been developed and validated, providing the test community with a cost-effective approach for evaluating AJ systems [1]. The test capability, referred to as the wavefront integrated threat simulator (WITS), utilizes a core architecture with mechanical tap-delay lines [2] and flexible personal computer interface options. Its expandability provides a range of simulated radio frequency (RF) antenna-element channels and capabilities with variable cost. The chief contribution of this paper lies in its calibration procedure which has been developed to minimize the aggregate angle of arrival (AoA) error for the GPS L1 frequency and the analytical analysis of the AoA error region. The WITS can be configured for a simple test configuration using a 4-channel system for $11,000 and may be expanded up to an N-channel configuration with high fidelity signal representation (i.e., Doppler, macro RF-path simulation with micro per-element calibrated delay ranges). The WITS validation includes per-channel calibration tables, per-channel theoretical phase contribution to angle-of-arrival (AoA) versus time, system level AoA error region analysis, AoA Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) estimate validation, output power requirements (potentially >120 dB Jamming to Signal ratio), and overall system latency. The modular design allows for user selection of appropriate fidelity and ensures a successful integration and evaluation of a GPS AJ system on multiple platforms and HWIL environments. © 2017 Proceedings of the Institute of Navigation Pacific Positioning, Navigation and Timing Meeting, Pacific PNT.

TI  - UAV Navigation using Signals of Opportunity in Urban Environments: A Review
AU  - Kapoor, Rohan
AU  - Ramasamy, Subramanian
AU  - Gardi, Alessandro
AU  - Sabatini, Roberto
AB  - Novel Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) systems are currently developed targeting the Required Total System Performance (RTSP) levels. Within RTSP, it is essential to meet the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) in all flight phases, especially considering the Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) evolutions in the UAS Traffic Management (UTM) context. However, in dense urban environments characterized by tall buildings and complex structural variations, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is prone to data degradations or complete loss of signal due to multipath effects, interference or antenna obscuration. Furthermore, there is always a risk of jamming and spoofing of GNSS signals, with low cost civilian GNSS receivers being more vulnerable to a spoof attack. Therefore, a number of Signals of Opportunity (SoOP) techniques are explored to improve the RNP when Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are employed in urban canyons. Electromagnetic signals found in urban environment including analogue/ digital radio, analogue/digital television, Wi-Fi, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) based signals are considered to model the system performance parameters. Implementation methods for using Signals of Opportunity such as Angle of Arrival (AOA), Time of Arrival (TOA), Received Signal Strength (RSS) and Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) are modeled and compared. Integration of SoOP techniques in novel low-cost Navigation and Guidance Systems (NGS) is also investigated. As SoOP were not initially designed for navigation purposes, no single source of SoOP for navigation can work in all environments and hence a SoOP source has to be selected based on specific requirements in the considered urban environment. Constraints of power and weight on the UAV besides hardware and software costs are also factors that are considered when selecting appropriate SoOP signal sources. Hence, there is a clear opportunity to provide considerable savings in both infrastructure as well as energy costs and thus providing a low-cost and low-volume integrated NGS for trusted aerial autonomous operations. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Considering the invalidation of the common airborne integrated navigation system caused by the satellite signal interference, this paper studies the new integrated navigation system, which utilizes the Aircraft Motion Model (AMM) to aid the MEMS-based low-accuracy Strap-down Inertial Navigation System (SINS). The new system operates as a backup airborne navigation method to improve the precision and reliability considerably. Two problems are studied in the paper: the precision problem that originates from the error of the aircraft's aerodynamic parameters, and the coupling problem that lies between the navigation system and the control system for the automatic aircraft. Therefore, the velocity matching of AMM and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is applied to compensate the aerodynamic parameters when the GNSS signal is stable. Meanwhile, the coupling problem is solved by switching from the automatic mode to manual mode intermittently. Based on a small-scaled fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with propeller, the simulation tests show that the GNSS could be used to evaluate several key aerodynamic parameters of the longitudinal channel, thus improving the precision of the integrated navigation system. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Modern warships are often equipped with small airstrips that are dedicated to helicopters or other vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) units. Therefore, this type of vessels should have navigation systems that provide process automation of take-off and landing for these flying units. Currently, the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is used for this purpose. The accuracy of the positioning based on GNSS may prove to be insufficient during automatic landing approach of unmanned aerial vehicles. In the military operation area, GNSS signals may be jamming or spoofing. Additionally, it may be limiting visibility related to smoke screens or natural factors, e.g. fog. Thus, there is a need for a dedicated radio navigation systems. This paper presents a concept of the local navigation system (LNS) that based on the signal Doppler frequency (SDF) location method. LNS allows positioning of the landing VTOL with high precision. The accuracy of VTOL positioning in LNS is shown on the basis of two scenarios of simulation studies. © 2016 IEEE.

AU  - Kia, Solmaz S.

T2  - IEEE Control Systems
AB  - Technological advances in ad hoc networking and the miniaturization of electromechanical systems are making possible the use of large numbers of mobile agents (for example, mobile robots, human agents, and unmanned vehicles) to perform surveillance, search and rescue, transport, and delivery tasks in aerial, underwater, space, and land environments. However, the successful execution of such tasks often hinges upon accurate position information, which is needed in lower-level locomotion and path-planning algorithms. Common techniques for the localization of mobile robots are the classical preinstalled beacon-based localization algorithms, fixed feature-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms, and Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation. However, these localization techniques work based on assumptions such as the existence of distinct and static features that can be revisited often or line of sight to GPS satellites, which may not be feasible for operations such as search and rescue, environment monitoring, and oceanic exploration. In the case of GPS navigation, there is also a current concern about signal jamming for outdoor navigation, especially for unmanned aerial vehicle coordination and control. Instead, cooperative localization is emerging as an alternative localization technique that can be employed in such scenarios. © 1991-2012 IEEE.

AU  - Warren, Michael

T2  - International Journal of Robotics Research
AB  - Visual Odometry is a key technology for robust and accurate navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles in a number of low altitude applications (<120 m), particularly in environments where access to a global positioning system is possible, but not guaranteed. Navigating via vision alone reduces dependence on a global positioning system and other global navigation satellite systems, enhancing navigation robustness even in the presence of jamming, spoofing or long dropouts. To date, however, most demonstrations of visual odometry are in close proximity to the ground or other structures and are often implemented as a monocular camera combined with inertial sensing, rather than vision alone, to account for scale drift. Stereo visual odometry has received little attention for applications beyond 30 m altitude due to the generally poor performance of stereo rigs for these extremely small baseline-to-depth ratios, otherwise termed long-range stereo. This paper demonstrates stereo visual pose estimation at altitudes of up to 120 m above ground level on a small fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle by adapting the traditional stereo visual odometry paradigm to explicitly account for inaccurate triangulation and poorly observed scale from the stereo baseline. In addition, issues related to long-range stereo such as biased sensing are investigated to justify the approach, and a novel bundle adjustment algorithm is presented capable of handling vibration induced structural deformation between the cameras. This is achieved by continually optimizing the stereo transform within a set of inequality bounds. Results are presented demonstrating the algorithm on field-gathered data from a 2 m wingspan fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle flying at 30-120 m altitude over a 6.5 km trajectory. © SAGE Publications.

AB  - A jammer-hunting UAV employs a radio frequency (RF) detection system and a navigation control scheme. The RF detection component uses a directional antenna and the unmanned aerial vehicle's (UAV) ability to rotate to determine a bearing to the jammer. The navigation control scheme selects a trajectory for making bearing measurements that enable rapid jammer localization, based on three bearing calculation methods, such as max, cross-correlation, and a modification of max leveraging the shape of the antenna's main lobe, known as max3.

AB  - To assist in the mitigation of the effects posed by Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) jammers, this paper demonstrates the use of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) capable of autonomously localizing the source of Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming in a live jamming exercise hosted by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Developing an autonomous UAV for jammer localization in a real-world environment needs to address three main challenges: accurate measurements of the jamming signal, rapid localization steps and reliable navigation in the presence of interference. Our system, Jammer Acquisition with GPS Exploration and Reconnaissance (JAGER), has been developed to address those main challenges for rapid localization and has been previously tested with localizing Wi-Fi signals. This paper outlines the modifications to JAGER required to be able to move from localizing Wi-Fi sources to localizing GPS jammers. Modifications include new sensing equipment for determining the bearing to the jammer and additional navigation systems to fly while the jammer is active. The main goal for the testing was to demonstrate the feasibility of JAGER to localize a GPS jammer at realistic distances and the performance of several different localization methods. The second goal was to explore possible GPS-denied navigation solutions.

TI  - Evaluation of georeferencing methods with respect to their suitability to address unsimilarity between the image to be referenced and the reference image
AU  - Brüstle, Stefan
AU  - Erdnuess, Bastian
AB  - In recent years, operational costs of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) have been massively decreasing. New sensors satisfying weight and size restrictions of even small UAS cover many different spectral ranges and spatial resolutions. This results in airborne imagery having become more and more available. Such imagery is used to address many different tasks in various fields of application. For many of those tasks, not only the content of the imagery itself is of interest, but also its spatial location. This requires the imagery to be properly georeferenced. Many UAS have an integrated GPS receiver together with some kind of INS device acquiring the sensor orientation to provide the georeference. However, both GPS and INS data can easily become unavailable for a period of time during a flight, e.g. due to sensor malfunction, transmission problems or jamming. Imagery gathered during such times lacks georeference. Moreover, even in datasets not affected by such problems, GPS and INS inaccuracies together with a potentially poor knowledge of ground elevation can render location information accuracy less than sufficient for a given task. To provide or improve the georeference of an image affected by this, an image to reference registration can be performed if a suitable reference is available, e.g. a georeferenced orthophoto covering the area of the image to be georeferenced. Registration and thus georeferencing is achieved by determining a transformation between the image to be referenced and the reference which maximizes the coincidence of relevant structures present both in the former and the latter. Many methods have been developed to accomplish this task. Regardless of their differences they usually tend to perform the better the more similar an image and a reference are in appearance. This contribution evaluates a selection of such methods all differing in the type of structure they use for the assessment of coincidence with respect to their ability to tolerate unsimilarity in appearance. Similarity in appearance is mainly dependent on the following aspects, namely the similarity of abstraction levels (Is the reference e.g. an orthophoto or a topographical map?), the similarity of sensor types and spectral bands (Is the image e.g. a SAR image and the reference a passively sensed one? Was e.g. a NIR sensor used capturing the image while a VIS sensor was used in the reference?), the similarity of resolutions (Is the ground sampling distance of the reference comparable to the one of the image?), the similarity of capture parameters (Are e.g. The viewing angles comparable in the image and in the reference?) and the similarity concerning the image content (Was there e.g. snow coverage present when the image was captured while this was not the case when the reference was captured?). The evaluation is done by determining the performance of each method with a set of image to be referenced and reference pairs representing various degrees of unsimilarity with respect to each of the above mentioned aspects of similarity. © 2016 SPIE..

AB  - Pseudolites system provide positioning service based on a ranging process similar to Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) that need all transmitters have consistent reference time and frequency. In airborne pseudolites navigation system applications, all UAVs are move continually and it is impossible to achieve real-time precision flight trajectories, which have more challenge for wireless time synchronization. This study provides a method based on direct two-way time and frequency transfer (TWTFT) link that calculate the clock difference by ranging differential delay and error compensating without UAVs’ accurate position. In addition, analysis of the synchronization performance in high dynamic and jamming situation will be showed by showing the effect of pseudolites clock drift, Sagnac and unsymmetrical interference.

AB  - This paper presents a new robust path planning and execution methodology for constrained linear systems, using reachable sequences of sets denoted funnels. Constraint tightening is used to guarantee the existence of a combined feedforward and affine disturbance-feedback policy to guide the system trajectory from anywhere within a set of initial states to a target set, through a sequence of intermediate sets forming the cross-section of the funnel. It is shown how the sets can be placed to guarantee robust obstacle avoidance for a known bounded disturbance. Numerical simulations are used to demonstrate the approach on a simple unmanned aerial vehicle model. © 2015 Engineers Australia.

AU  - Gao, Wei

AB  - A test method for electronic jamming effect on missiles is proposed, in which the unmanned aircraft piloted by a homing seeker is used to simulate the jammed missile object to test the jamming effect of electronic warfare weapons on missiles. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated and verified by smokescreen jamming test on the simulated guidance flight of an unmanned airship piloted by a TV seeker, which shows that the smokescreen can produce marked jamming effect on the guidance flight and make the airship deviate from the guidance flight course and the expected target. Compared with the existing test methods for electronic jamming effect on missiles, the method features as easier operation, lower cost and better safety, thus could have wide prospect of application in electronic warfare test and evaluation. © 2015 IEEE.

TI  - The enigmatic juridical regime of unmanned maritime systems
AU  - Giunta, Leonida
AB  - The growing use of robotics in the maritime domain is about to pose questions on legal fallouts of autonomous systems to the international community. Unmanned maritime systems (UMS) such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are being increasingly employed for environmental and scientific studies. Applications of not weaponized robotic platforms for maritime security, littoral protection, antisubmarine warfare, and mine countermeasures are being investigated quite successfully both by civilian and military bodies. And more capabilities are expected to be developed for the archaeological surveys and Search And Rescue (SAR) operations. These growing spread and interest are due to the fact that, among the new maritime technologies, UMS are some of the most energy-efficient ones since they are usually equipped with small engines or they can even fly in the water without any propulsion but just using waves and currents as for example gliders do. Nevertheless the regulatory framework is lying far away from the technological fast advancement. Current experimental operations are forced to be always conducted under special authorisations and area clearances. But what is stopping the authorities to rule the use of these tools? The fact is that the issue of responsibility and liability for autonomous robots is difficult to be solved, even for not weaponized systems. Differently from aerial drones, whose civil use have been recently regulated in most countries, including the United States and the European Union, referring to pilot liability, unmanned vehicles are, as said, 'un-manned', without man in the loop or with men even far from remote control, being in a domain where radio connections are limited to submerging windows and control is transferred to software programming. This makes the application of personal responsibility challenging, while indeed undermining basics principles to which the law of the sea applies, for example, in the area of navigation safety: could UMS be defined as vessels according to international conventions or are they to be considered something different? What's the real degree of independence encompassed within the term autonomy? These thoughts lead to include into consideration also manned and remotely operated vessels, whose wire connection to human operators is clearer but which pose in any case questions on legal status. This paper is devoted to identify the legal blanks in the field and analyse the applicability to UMS of maritime legal regimes and present regulations at international level. First of all, particular attention will be paid in trying to ascertain the status of such devices in order to reach a categorization of them under a maritime law perspective. Secondly, the article will analyse the juridical implications deriving from the various maritime zones as defined by the law of the sea towards the transit, the use and the operation of UMS. Going into details, the circulation of the aforesaid instruments is going to be examined in the light of the 'innocent passage' institution. Lastly, the research will be focused on the liability arising from the employment of these systems in case of collision with other vessels, cultural and natural assets, private goods, or other harbour infrastructures and, more in general, where a violation of the navigational rules against casualties could be recognised. In particular, the study will mainly involve the IMO Conventions consecrated to safety or security measures and environmental issues. © 2015 IEEE.

AU  - Kaczurova, Marketa

AU  - Kaczur, Martin
AB  - One of the fundamental goals of electronic intelligence (ELINT), respectively passive surveillance systems (PSS), is the process of determining the position of the target, the output of which is to estimate the target position. It depends on the analysis of the received radio signals transmitted by the target. Information sources for long-range PSS are especially radio signals from active onboard aircraft systems or more generally flying airborne objects. Due to the physical possibilities for detection are for contemporary PSS real source of information signal shipboard radars, navigation interrogators, identification transponders, jammers and means of data transfer (Data Links). The development of aircraft is mainly focused on the real using of technologies, known collectively as STEALTH, to reduce the effective reflective surface radar aircraft, which is decisive for the detection of range to targets while reducing radio emission targets. In this category we find also Low-dimensional air targets - UVA (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), UCAV (Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle) and other targets that have minimal reflective surface have given its geometrical dimensions. This article is focused on the analysis of signals of objects of interest in terms of their origin. There are two main groups of sources. Firstly, primary actively generated airborne signals (radar, navigation, identification, jamming, data and communication) and secondarily emitted signals generating due to reflection and scattering of the incident to the performance of the air target asynchronously or synchronously operating terrestrial or airborne transmitters. © 2015 University of Defence.

AU  - Ramasamy, Subramanian
AB  - The integration of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) integrity augmentation functionalities in Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) has the potential to provide an integrity-augmented Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) solution suitable for cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios. In this paper, we evaluate the opportunities offered by this integration, proposing a novel approach that maximizes the synergies between Avionics Based Integrity Augmentation (ABIA) and UAS cooperative/non-cooperative SAA architectures. When the specified collision risk thresholds are exceeded, an avoidance manoeuvre is performed by implementing a heading-based differential geometry or pseudospectral optimization to generate a set of optimal trajectory solutions free of mid-air conflicts. The optimal trajectory is selected using a cost function with minimum time constraints and fuel penalty criteria weighted for separation distance. The optimal avoidance trajectory also considers the constraints imposed by the ABIA in terms of UAS platform dynamics and GNSS satellite elevation angles (plus jamming avoidance when applicable), thus preventing degradation or loss of navigation data during the Track, Decision and Avoidance (TDA) process. The performance of this Integrity-Augmented SAA (IAS) architecture was evaluated by simulation case studies involving cooperative and non-cooperative platforms. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IAS architecture is capable of performing high-integrity conflict detection and resolution when GNSS is used as the primary source of navigation data. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - GPS is vulnerable to deliberate jamming signals and unintentional interference signals. For counteracting this weakness in GPS, array antenna based anti-jamming methods and jammer localization systems are studied. Jammer localization methods among counteracting method of GPS weak signal are studied to detection jammer location and jammer type for eliminating jammer or jammer signal effect. The jammer location estimation performance of jammer localization systems is determined according to jammer signal power, jammer type, array antenna type, jammer localization algorithm, location of jammer and receiver and etc. furthermore, velocity, trajectory and position of UAV have and effects on performance of UAV based Jammer location systems. In this paper, software based simulation platform was designed to take account of these various effects of jammer localization systems.

AB  - The increased integration of GPS in the airspace to improve efficiency and enhance safety comes with an increased risk of harm from a GPS jamming device. In an effort to protect the airspace of the future from the effects of GPS jammers by rapidly mitigating their effects, we are developing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based solution for the localization of a jammer that can operate at an airport. The development of this UAV solution is centered on two main areas: the localization of the jammer and navigation in a denied environment. In this paper, we examine developments in the first area, the localization of the jammer. This paper examines the two primary components of our localization system: radio frequency (RF) detection and a navigation control scheme for localization. The RF detection component uses a directional antenna and the UAV's ability to rotate to determine a bearing to the jammer. The navigation control scheme selects a trajectory leading to bearing measurements that allow rapid localization of the jammer. The ability to make reliable bearing measurements is paramount to quickly localizing the jammer. The research in this paper analyzes our directional antenna and three bearing calculation methods: max, cross-correlation, and a modification of max leveraging the shape of the antenna's main lobe (referred to as max3 in this paper). Flight test data is used to analyze the performance of these methods at various distances from the jammer. Localization is achieved by determining and moving to the best locations to make signal observations and merging these observations to get an accurate estimate of jammer location. In order to pick measurement locations that minimize localization time, we've formulated the problem of picking these locations as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). This closed-loop controller determines the next measurement location given the information gathered from prior measurements. Flight tests with this control scheme were performed and are presented in this paper. The effect of bearing measurement quality on the decision-making is also shown.

AB  - The Jammer Acquisition with GPS Exploration & Reconnaissance (JAGER) project is designed to eliminate disruption caused by GPS jammers through their rapid localization. The jamming of the GPS satellite signal by a powerful, ground-based transmitter represents a grave threat to the many industries that rely on GPS for operation. This paper presents research demonstrating the development of a fully autonomous, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based system for locating GPS jammers. The goal of our work is to localize a jammer to within 30 m in under 15 minutes in an area comparable to that of an airport, to be able to locate multiple, simultaneous jammers, and navigate in intermittent GPS and GPS-denied environments using a combination of GPS and alternate navigation aids. The system should be inexpensive and built from commercially available or open-source parts, software, avionics, and sensors. We have modified a commercially available airframe to be able to fly at high speed for up to 20 minutes with a 5 kg experimental payload. Experiments can be easily switched in and out using a unique, quick-release fastening mechanism. The UAV's central autopilot and flight controller communicates navigation and status information between experimental payloads and the ground station using MAVLink protocol. For the jammer-hunting scenario, we implement both alternate position, navigation, and timing (APNT) and tracking experiments. The APNT equipment records position data at a wide range of frequencies and can determine the vehicle's position in GPS-denied conditions. The tracking equipment uses a directional antenna and partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)-based algorithms to calculate the jammer's believed location. We present results of flight tests performed at JIFX 15-1 at Camp Roberts, CA, that recorded GPS, universal access transceiver (UAT), and distance measuring equipment (DME) data at a range of altitudes. The vehicle's position can be calculated not only using GPS, but also from the UAT and DME information collected. This is the first step towards true, real-time GPS-denied navigation. We also present the path forward for integration and testing of the tracking equipment and algorithms over the coming months.

TI  - Establishing antenna and receiver characteristics for addressing multipath interference for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigating urban canyons
AU  - Khan, Saeed M.
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) flying through urban canyons are subject to multipath signals as a result of reflection, refraction, and diffraction of satellite signals travelling to the receiver; this can lead to positional inaccuracies in this time-critical operation that can lead to crashes. Indeed, analytical models show that for a GPS L1-C/A (coarse or clear signal/acquisition), the time to detect a satellite signal increases considerably under conditions of multipath interference. Traditionally, two different approaches have been taken to dealing with the multipath problem. One approach involves signal processing and the other involves designing an antenna (spatial processing) capable of rejecting multipath signals. While several signal processing solutions for dealing with multipath impact exist, they require advanced receiver architectures that either mitigate the effect of multipath signals or use signals identified as multipath to enhance location accuracy. A question that remains to be answered is whether or not acquisition time for satellite signals can be optimized by carefully matching antenna and receiver. © 2014 IEEE.

TI  - Avionics-based GNSS integrity augmentation for unmanned aerial systems sense-and-avoid
AU  - Sabatini, Roberto
AU  - Moore, Terry
AU  - Hill, Chris J.
AB  - This paper investigates the synergies between a GNSS Avionics Based Integrity Augmentation (ABIA) system and a novel Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Sense-and-Avoid (SAA) architecture for cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios. The integration of ABIA with SAA has the potential to provide an integrity-augmented SAA solution that will allow the safe and unrestricted access of UAS to commercial airspace. The candidate SAA system uses Forward-Looking Sensors (FLS) for the non-cooperative case and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) for the cooperative case. In the non-cooperative scenario, the system employs navigation-based image stabilization with image morphology operations and a multi-branch Viterbi filter for obstacle detection, which allows heading estimation. The system utilizes a Track-to-Track (T) algorithm for data fusion that allows combining data from different tracks obtained with FLS and/or ADS-B depending on the scenario. Successively, it utilizes an Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm to estimate the state vector allowing a prediction of the intruder trajectory over a specified time horizon. Both in the cooperative and non-cooperative cases, the risk of collision is evaluated by setting a threshold on the Probability Density Function (PDF) of a Near Mid-Air Collision (NMAC) event over the separation area. So, if the specified threshold is exceeded, an avoidance manoeuvre is performed based on a heading-based Differential Geometry (DG) algorithm and optimized utilizing a cost function with minimum time constraints and fuel penalty criteria weighted as a function of separation distance. Additionally, the optimised avoidance trajectory considers the constraints imposed by the ABIA in terms of GNSS constellation satellite elevation angles, preventing degradation or losses of navigation data during the whole SAA loop. This integration scheme allows real-time trajectory corrections to re-establish the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) when actual GNSS accuracy degradations and/or data losses take place (e.g., due to aircraft-satellite relative geometry, GNSS receiver tracking, interference, jamming or other external factors). Various simulation case studies were accomplished to evaluate the performance of this Integrity-Augmented SAA (IAS) architecture. The selected host platform was the AEROSONDE Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and the simulation cases addressed a variety of cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios in a representative cross-section of the AEROSONDE operational flight envelope. The simulation results show that the proposed IAS architecture is an excellent candidate to perform high-integrity Collision Detection and Resolution (CD&R) utilizing GNSS as the primary source of navigation data, providing solid foundation for future research and developments in this domain.

AB  - Aiming at improving the survivability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in radar threat situation, a method of UAV route planning based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is proposed. Compared with the previous model of the route planning, a variety of qualitative factors and quantitative factors, such as the spatial positions of both UAV and radar and the detection probability of the radar, are introduced for providing a more accurate description of radar threat and the jamming effectiveness of UAV. Then the ant colony algorithm is applied to the route planning problem based on the dynamic ECM model.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become one of the most popular and promising means for both military and civilian posts and academic research areas. Localization of the UAVs and persistent tracking of a UAV have vital importance to provide a UAV with navigation information and help to cope with getting lost permanently. Indeed, inertial navigation system (INS) and global positioning system (GPS) seem to be adequate for navigation of UAVs. However, an alternative augmented navigation system for UAVs should be taken into consideration since INS has accumulated errors and GPS always has the possibility of jamming and satellite signal loss. Unmanned air systems (UASs) are playing increasingly prominent roles in defense programs and strategy around the world. For many of applications to develop into maturity, the reliability of UASs will need to increase, their capabilities will need to be extended further, their ease of use will need to be improved, and their cost will have to come down. In this paper the fusion between the data derived from the magnetometer, rate-gyro, accelerometer, pitot tube, pressure and the GPS is integrated in one system using an extended kalman filter (EKF) which uses a linear error model to estimate the errors in the states for UAV to enhance its performances. The proposed system introduces a robust navigation based on bistatic radar and bi-sensor for UAVs flight dynamics with decreases the faults in operational environment. © 2014 IEEE.

AU  - Brewer, Eric

AU  - McGraw, Gary A.
AB  - Several aerial platforms rely on decimeter-level relative position accuracy for various applications including automatic takeoff and landing, precision targeting, and airborne refueling. For such applications, a Real Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS system provides a relatively low cost, robust, and reliable solution. Current commercial RTK products are inherently susceptible to jamming and spoofing. The Selective Availability Anti-Spoof Module (SAASM) implementations to date typically relied on relatively large and complicated architectures which would be difficult to port into a small (Groups 1-3) Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) due to Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints. This paper describes the architecture, algorithms, and testing approach from Rockwell Collins high integrity relative navigation system including a SAASM-based RTK implementation for small UAS. A variant of the system was implemented for the Navy's Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (STUAS) program. The STUAS system performed its first successful ship-based launch and recoveries on the U.S.S. Mesa Verde using Rockwell Collins high integrity relative navigation system in February of 2013. © 2014 IEEE.

TI  - Design and assessment of a dual frequency GPS intelligent signal tracking loop for interference mitigation
AU  - Kamel, Ahmed M.
AB  - Unmanned Ariel Vehicles (UAVs) are playing a major role in nowadays battle scenarios. Using UAVs in the autonomous mode means that the vehicle is totally dependent on its sensors to complete the required mission. The main navigation sensor in most of the UAVs is the Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. The main disadvantage of using GPS as a primary mean of navigation is the dependence on the received very weak GPS satellite signals. This disadvantage lead to main and easy way to threat the UAV by intentionally transmits a jamming signal to its GPS antenna. A new GPS signal phase and frequency lock loops (PLLs and FLLs) that depend on intelligent control and particularly fuzzy logic systems have been firstly introduced in (Kamel 2010). This design has been modified to cope with interference and proved a robust performance in the presence of dynamics and low and moderate levels of signal jamming as presented in (Kamel, Borio et al. 2011) and (Kamel, Borio et al. 2011). The used Fuzzy Frequency Phase Lock Loop (FFPLL) uses both frequency and phase discriminators outputs to generate the required frequency change to tune the Numerically Controlled Oscillator (NCO) that generates the local signal to follow the incoming signal frequency and phase. The main core of any fuzzy system is its Membership Functions (MF) that map the inputs/outputs to defined linguistic variables describe the input/output state. The system discriminators input signals are mainly contaminated by thermal noise which is considered the main source of signal noise. The distribution of signal noise is affected by signal dynamics and signal power level or in other words; the carrier-to-noise density ratio (C/No) and hence the interference level. The Fuzzy system MFs are designed such that they cover the signal normal distribution. The MF mean is affected by the signal dynamics and MF standard deviation is affected by the signal power. At certain level of interference the system is not able to continuously track the incoming signal and lock is lost (Kamel, Borio et al. 2011). This motivated the use of another GPS signal to aid the main L1 C/A signal. In this paper the possibility of expanding the design of the fuzzy tracking system to include a second GPS frequency particularly L2C signal is explored. System design of possible integrated configurations, test and analysis are introduced. Test results show that using L2C Doppler aiding to the L1 fuzzy tracking loop enables the system to maintain signal lock at high levels of L1 signal interference which was not possible using the classical techniques of the original fuzzy system design.

AB  - Considering the emphasis on network-centric concepts of warfare in recent battlefield environments, the study of location information has become more important. This is because most military weapons use GNSSs (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) such as GPS and Galileo to track position information. Situations in which it is impossible to use these systems have been increased by many factors such as jamming attacks, reception failure, and politics. In this study, we propose a localization method that uses UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and TDOA (Time Differential of Arrival) method to determine receiver position in situations in which using GNSS is locally impossible. We also consider the building of a slim-budget localization system independent of GNSS and how to operate it efficiently. The simulation results show that our scheme is applicable on battlefield, the feasibility is proved by the accuracy, the DOP (Dilution of Precise) and the coverage. © 2013 IEEE.

Localization of the UAVs and persistent tracking of a UAV have vital importance to provide a UAV with navigation information and help to cope with getting lost permanently. Indeed, Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) seem to be adequate for navigation of UAVs. However, an alternative augmented navigation system for UAVs should be taken into consideration since INS has accumulated errors and GPS always has the possibility of jamming and satellite signal loss. Terrain Referenced Navigation (TRN) could be a good alternative as a decision support system for these main systems. This study aims to detect the location of a lost or GPS-disabled UAV throughout a planned flight by using only the terrain data. In addition, assumptions and limitations are minimized for the sake of simplifying the process to apply this methodology on a real UAV in the future, e.g. flight through all directions with physically possible turn rates is allowed. In order to provide data of the terrain, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the flight region with 30m resolution is exploited. The proposed method is based on searching and matching the collected elevation values of the terrain below UAV within the DEM and makes use of simulation techniques to test the accuracy and performance. The whole algorithm utilizes a sequence of elevation values with a predefined length (i.e. profile). Mainly, all possible profiles are generated before the flight and stored in a huge search space. We identify, sort and classify these elevation profiles in order to perform search operations in a small subset of the huge set. During the flight, a sequence of terrain elevations, which is computed with the help of radar and barometric altimeter measurements, is searched within a small neighborhood of corresponding profile set. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - GPS is a critical sensor for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) due to its accuracy, global coverage and small hardware footprint, but is subject to denial due to signal blockage or RF interference. When GPS is unavailable, position, velocity and attitude (PVA) performance from other inertial and air data sensors is not suffient, especially for small UASs. Recently, image-based navigation algorithms have been developed to address GPS outages for UASs, since most of these platforms already include a camera as standard equipage. Performing absolute navigation with real-time aerial images requires georeferenced data, either images or landmarks, as a reference. Georeferenced imagery is readily available today, but requires a large amount of storage, whereas collections of discrete landmarks are compact but must be generated by pre-processing. An alternative, compact source of georeferenced data having large coverage area is open source vector maps from which meta-objects can be extracted for matching against real-time acquired imagery. We have developed a novel, automated approach called MINA (Meta Image Navigation Augmenters), which is a synergy of machine-vision and machine-learning algorithms for map aided navigation. As opposed to existing image map matching algorithms, MINA utilizes publicly available open-source geo-referenced vector map data, such as OpenStreetMap, in conjunction with real-time optical imagery from an on-board, monocular camera to augment the UAS navigation computer when GPS is not available. The MINA approach has been experimentally validated with both actual flight data and flight simulation data and results are presented in the paper. © 2013 SPIE.

AB  - Navigation has been a major challenge for the successful operation of an autonomous aircraft. Although success has been achieved using active methods such as radar, sonar, lidar and the global positioning system (GPS), such methods are not always suitable due to their susceptibility to jamming and outages. Vision, as a passive navigation method, is considered as an excellent alternative; however, the development of vision-based autonomous systems for outdoor environments has proven difficult. For flying systems, this is compounded by the additional challenges posed by environmental and atmospheric conditions. In this paper, we present a novel passive vision-based algorithm which is invariant to illumination, scale and rotation. We use a three stage landmark recognition algorithm and an algorithm for waypoint matching. Our algorithms have been tested in both synthetic and real-world outdoor environments demonstrating overall good performance. We further compare our feature matching method with the speed-up robust features (SURF) method with results demonstrating that our method outperforms the SURF method in feature matching as well as computational cost. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.

TI  - A probabilistically robust path planning algorithm for UAVs using rapidly-exploring random trees

T2  - Journal of Intelligent and Robotic Systems: Theory and Applications
AB  - The computationally efficient search for robust feasible paths for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the presence of uncertainty is a challenging and interesting area of research. In uncertain environments, a " conservative" planner may be required but then there may be no feasible solution. In this paper, we use a chance constraint to limit the probability of constraint violation and extend this framework to handle uncertain dynamic obstacles. The approach requires the satisfaction of probabilistic constraints at each time step in order to guarantee probabilistic feasibility. The rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm, which enjoys the computational benefits of a sampling-based algorithm, is used to develop a real-time probabilistically robust path planner. It incorporates the chance constraint framework to account for uncertainty within the formulation and includes a number of heuristics to improve the algorithm's performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can be used for efficient identification and execution of probabilistically safe paths in real-time. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The data-link is a key subsystem for any Unmanned Arial Vehicle (UAV), Surface to Air Missile (SAM), Air to Air Missile (AAM) and Air to Surface Missile (ASM). It provides two-way communication, either upon demand or on a continuous basis. An up-link provides control of the air vehicle flight path and commands to its payloads. The downlink provides both a low data rate channel to acknowledge commands and transmit status information about the aerial vehicle and a high data rate channel for payload data such as video, radar and navigation. In this paper we describe a novel secured, two way, high speed RF command and video data link system which enables real time, high speed, continuous data exchange between aircraft/missile/high dynamic vehicles and ground entities and vice-versa. This system uses advanced spread spectrum modulation, spread spectrum coding and decoding techniques to ensure signal security and multi-user access. This paper also discusses the RF data link system design issues faced in its development and the methods, technologies employed to overcome these challenges. It describes the system Architecture, behavioral operation and validation of the system. It also details successful demonstration of the technology and future plans for improvement of signal security and range of operation. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Accurate position, velocity and attitude (PVA) information is crucial for the success of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) military operations and GPS (Global Positioning System) is a critical sensor for such platforms. However, GPS is subject to denial in UAV operational environments due to blockage or Radio Frequency (RF) interference. In recent years, much progress has been made in developing image navigation algorithms for UAVs that can be implemented in real-time and provide acceptable accuracy performance. Even so, some issues still remain such as the robustness and reliability of an image-based solution, as well as storage requirements for reference maps that can be used for absolute navigation. To address these limitations of GPS Denied UAV image navigation a novel, automated algorithm called MINA (Meta Image Navigation Augmenters), a synergy of machine-vision and machine-learning algorithms for absolute navigation using georeferenced map objects has been developed. MINA utilizes geo-referenced map data in conjunction with real-time optical imagery from an onboard, monocular camera to compute absolute navigation solutions. Vector maps, which are much more compact than image (raster) maps, can be used by the MINA algorithm meaning that a georeferenced map for a very large operational region can be stored onboard the aircraft in an optimized XML database. Digital terrain elevation maps can also be used as an input for the MINA algorithm. The vector or digital terrain map data is interpreted, and spatial areas are rendered into the image domain so they can be correlated against real-time aerial imagery for generating correspondences that provide position measurement information for enhanced PVA state determination. Image navigation robustness is enhanced by tracking and correlating more complex image objects in the real-time image stream, which are less susceptible for false matches and provide rotational as well positional measurement information. The MINA algorithm has been experimentally tested with both actual, recorded flight data and flight simulation data. Performance results are presented in the paper.

AB  - Most aircraft, whether manned or unmanned, depend on the Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation. However, GPS signals are susceptible to jamming and spoofing. A researcher recently demonstrated the use of spoofing to take control of a ship in the Mediterranean Sea. By feeding counterfeit signals to the ship, he was able to drive it far off course. All the time, the navigation system reported the vessel was moving calmly along its intended course. The same researcher also demonstrated the ability to spoof unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a navigation system that does not rely on GPS. The only sensor required is a digital camera. The system works by taking a photograph of the ground and georegistering it to a reference image or digital elevation model (DEM) with the GeoMI™ georegistration software. By transferring geospatial information from the DEM to the photo, the system calculates the position and orientation of the aircraft. The process is fast enough to perform in real time and suitable for use as a primary or backup navigation system for aircraft, UAVs, and cruise missiles. For nighttime navigation, the system could be extended to infrared or radar imagery. Experimental results show that navigation accuracies of 2 meters CE90 can be achieved. © 2013 IEEE.

TI  - All-source navigation for enhancing uav operations in gps-denied environments
AU  - Williams, Paul
AU  - Crump, Michael
AB  - The drive towards utilizing small, cheap, autonomous aerial vehicles for military operations means that navigation systems that are robust to GPS denial must be employed. The simplest option available is to increase the accuracy of the inertial measurement unit (IMU), but this can substantially increase the price per operational unit. This paper presents an overview of the All-Source Navigation system developed by BAE Systems Australia based on inexpensive MEMS IMUs and a supporting image processing unit. The navigation system is capable of sustaining the operational flight capability of the vehicle for prolonged periods of time compared to the pure inertial solution. At its core, All-Source Navigation makes use of SLAM techniques. A variety of additional aiding sources are fused into the inertial navigation solution to give improved navigational accuracy during flight. The system is capable of performing both conventional static, as well as in-flight alignment. All-Source Navigation is demonstrated on the Kingfisher 2 UAV platform at the West Sale test facility.

The problem of estimating the state parameters of a flying vehicle is addressed in the particular situation where the GPS information is unavailable or unreliable due to jamming situations for instance. The proposed state estimation approach fuses information from inertial and image sensors. Absolute localization is obtained through image-to-map registration. For this purpose, 2D satellite images are used. The algorithms presented are implemented and tested on-board an industrial unmanned helicopter. Flight-test results will be presented.

AB  - This study, convened and funded by the U.S. Army, analyzes the tradeoffs involved in designing a local or theater GPS replacement system. Our operating assumption was that such a system would not be constrained by legacy GPS architecture, equipment, or waveforms. It could therefore employ more efficient Z<inf>4</inf> cyclostationary ranging codes and reap the benefits of two-way measurement and communication including: elimination of User Device (UD) clock error, dramatic reduction of the UD infill bandwidth by computing the UD position on the Reference Device (RD), code ambiguity elimination, and (perhaps) the use of cognitive radio techniques to resist jamming. The existence of robust cellular telephony with compact handsets in very crowded spectrum shared by many users testifies to the viability of this approach. We studied a physical architecture in which the RDs were carried by Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs). It was shown that such architectures are robust to jamming, and that the Horizontal Dilution Of Precision (HDOP) benefits greatly from two-way ranging. We also described how the use of Mission Level Autonomy (MLA) by a resource limited UAS constellation provides robust location services to dynamically changing ground operations in a near optimal way. For operations over very large areas of denied airspace, we considered geolocation of static UDs from two-way satellite links which are consistent with specifications developed in the Operationally Responsive Satellite (ORS) program. Two-way satellite links that can measure Doppler as well as range enable single-satellite, single-epoch geolocation. This reduces the number of satellites required in the constellation by about a factor of two. A notional satellite design consistent with launch from an SSBN submarine was presented.

AB  - Method of automatic target angle tracking by sum-and-difference monopulse radar covers radiolocation sphere and specifically monopulse direction finding systems. It can be used in order to increase guidance accuracy, for example, for antiaircraft missiles and of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to radar targets such as: radio beacons; aerial vehicles reflecting the radio signal that illuminates them; aerial vehicles and ground-based devices radiating radio signals and jamming signals. The aim of the method consists in the assurance of reliability and stability and in the enhancement of guidance accuracy of automatic target angle tracking due to elimination of automatic tracking losses and great errors arising during the influence of the signals of orthogonal polarization or polarization close to it. The proposed method provides full protection from polarization jamming for all types monopulse radars. © 2010 EuMA.

AB  - Bistatic radars offer several advantages when compared to their monostatic counterparts. In addition to increased performance, sensitivity, coverage and revisit times, all of them parameters which are mainly dependent on their spatial configuration, bistatic radars offer the objective advantage of being more robust to jamming, since the receiver operates as a mere passive system. The proposed system consists of a spacebore radar transmitter illuminating an area of interest and one or several radar receivers mounted on a UAV to perform a two-goal mission: a) help autonomous navigation of the UAV by performing the sense and avoid function, and b) perform surveillance of the overflown area using high-resolution remote sensing techniques. Although the requirements for these significantly different tasks might seem distant, having a spacebore transmitter ensures that the coverage needed for both puroses is achievable. The system can provide a cheap and robust manner for enabling global UAV flight, while enabling continuous all-weather imaging capabilities. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.

TI  - Use of GPS navigation in the Norwegian naval strike missile
AU  - Meen, Morten
AU  - Nielson, John T.
AB  - The Naval Strike Missile (NSM) Anti-Ship Missile is an autonomous, long-range, precision missile. The missile is designed to engage high-value, well-defended targets at sea and in littoral waters. The navigation system consists of a tactical grade Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) aided by a military L1/L2 SAASM GPS receiver and a laser altimeter to provide terrain correlation for overland flights, and height estimation when over water. The fiber optic IMU is the core sensor in the navigation system. INS algorithms integrate IMU measurements which are combined with measurements from a GPS receiver and a laser altimeter in a Kalman filter. Correction algorithms calculate position, velocity and attitude based on the IMU measurements and the error estimates. The IMU also provides aiding data to the GPS during flight. This approach aids initial acquisition and ensures rapid reacquisition after satellite outages due to maneuvers or jamming. The main objective of the navigation system is to determine the missile's position and attitude during flight and send data to the Flight Control System which in turn makes corrections to keep the missile on its programmed flight path, in the position and time domains. The purpose of the navigation system is to guide the missile to a predefined error-circle. Typically this defines the start of the terminal phase where an intelligent infrared imaging seeker (I<sup>3</sup>R) steers the missile towards the selected target. Initial flight tests were performed using a small propeller aircraft in order to test the navigation system with the laser altimeter. High speed flight tests were later performed by installing the navigation components and the seeker inside a fuel tank and mounted on an F-5 fighter aircraft. Final flight tests were performed with the complete missile system with several test firings in France and in the US.

TI  - Fusion of inertial, optical flow and airspeed measurements for UAV navigation in GPS-denied environments
AU  - Solovieva, Andrey
AU  - Rutkowski, Adam J.
AB  - This paper describes the data fusion approach that is developed for navigation of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for those applications where the Global Positioning System (GPS) signals are denied. Example scenarios include navigation under interference and jamming and urban navigation missions. The system architecture is biologically inspired and exploits measurements that are utilized by flying insects for self-localization purposes. The data fusion algorithm implements the Kalman filter mechanization that fuses INS data (position velocity and attitude), optical flow data from a monocular downward looking visual system (scaled body-frame vehicle velocity components), and compass measurements (azimuth angle). Kalman filter measurement observables are formulated in a complimentary form, i.e., as differences between optical flow/compass measurements and INS states that are projected into the measurement domain. The filter estimates inertial error states and error in the flight height. We present the navigation solution architecture and demonstrate its feasibility using simulations and actual data experiments. Also, we compare our results to a data fusion algorithm that fuses airspeed and optical flow measurements © 2009 SPIE.

AB  - Cooperative and intelligent path planning is important for UAVs to carry out coordinated Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) in adversarial environments. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic data fusion aided platform routing algorithm for cooperative ISR. Our approach consists of three closely coupled components: 1) Closed-loop data fusion. The Level 1 (Object), Level 2 (Situation) and Level 3 (threat) data fusion form a closed-loop structure, in which Markov game theoretic intent inferences will execute from the results of Level 1 and Level 2 results. The estimated threat intents will be fed back to the Level 2 fusion to improve the performance of the entity aggregation. 2) Cooperative platform routing based on Pareto-optimization, social foraging, and cooperative jamming. Given the threat information including the threat intents from the data fusion module, a Pareto-optimal problem is formed and Graph-cut based fast solution serves as a reference trajectory for a foraging algorithm, which further dynamically refines the reference path to avoid pop-up obstacles detected along the planned path. 3) Display/Monitor Module, in which relevant threats and constraints information are indicated, the terrain data are shown, and current real route and planned route are highlighted, compared, and evaluated. The commander's suggestions can be inputted in this mode. ©2008 IEEE.

AB  - The time-difference of arrival techniques are adapted to locate networked enemy radars using a cooperative team of unmanned aerial vehicles. The team is engaged in deceiving the radars, which limits where they can fly and requires accurate radar positions to be known. Two time-differences of radar pulse arrivals at two vehicle pairs are used to localize one of the radars. An explicit solution for the radar position in polar coordinates is developed. The solution is first used for position estimation given "noisy" measurements, which shows that the vehicle trajectories significantly affect estimation accuracy. Analyzing the explicit solution leads to The Angle Rule, which gives the optimal vehicle configuration for the angle estimate. Analyzing the Fisher Information Matrix leads to The Coordinate Rule, which gives a different optimal configuration for the position estimate. A linearized time-varying model is also formulated and an Extended Kalman Filter applied. This estimation scheme is compared with the earlier one, with the second showing overall improvement in reducing the variance of the estimate. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - The United States Navy seeks the capability to land manned and unmanned aerial vehicles autonomously on an aircraft carrier using GPS. To deliver this capability, the Navy is developing a navigation system called the Sea-Based Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS). Because standard GPS is not sufficiently precise to land aircraft on a shortened, constantly moving runway, Sea-Based JPALS leverages dual-frequency, carrier-phase differential GPS navigation. Carrier phase measurements, derived from the sinusoidal waveforms underlying the GPS signal, are very precise but not necessarily accurate unless the user resolves the ambiguity associated with the sinusoid’s periodicity. Ensuring the validity of ambiguity resolution is the central challenge for the high-integrity, safety-critical JPALS application. Based on a multi-year, multi-institution collaborative study, this paper proposes V. SUMMARY This paper proposed an integrity architecture to enable precise automated landings on the deck of an aircraft carrier for Sea-Based JPALS. The proposed system features a two-stage navigation algorithm designed to meet the rigorous guidance quality specifications of Sea-Based JPALS. Because Sea-Based JPALS may operate under jamming, the impacts of interference suppression technologies on guidance quality were analyzed and a jamming-mitigation strategy using inertial/GPS fusion and adaptive CRPA arrays was recommended. A modified navigation algorithm called decoupled-estimation monitoring was defined to mitigate the integrity risk associated with residual CRPA calibration errors. Finally, a minimal set of monitors were identified to preserve Sea-Based JPALS integrity during system fault events. System architecture and navigation algorithms alleviate the need for several monitoring algorithms required in civilian differential navigation systems such as the Federal Aviation Administration’s Local Area Augmentation System. (These monitors might nonetheless be incorporated in JPALS to improve reliability and streamline system approval). Preliminary availability analyses indicate that the proposed system meets guidance quality requirements whether or not jamming is present and whether or not a hazardous failure has occurred. © 2008 IEEE

TI  - Observability analysis and active control for airborne SLAM
AU  - Bryson, Mitch
AU  - Sukkarieh, Salah
T2  - IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems
AB  - An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is tasked to explore an unknown environment and to map the features it finds, but must do so without the use of infrastructure-based localisation systems such as GPS, or any a priori terrain data. The UAV navigates using a statistical estimation technique known as simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) which allows for the simultaneous estimation of the location of the UAV as well as the location of the features it sees. SLAM offers a unique approach to vehicle localisation with potential applications including planetary exploration, or when GPS is denied (for example under intentional GPS jamming, or applications where GPS signals cannot be reached), but more importantly can be used to augment already existing systems to improve robustness to navigation failure. One key requirement for SLAM to work is that it must reobserve features, and this has two effects: firstly, the improvement of the location estimate of the feature; and secondly, the improvement of the location estimate of the platform because of the statistical correlations that link the platform to the feature. So our UAV has two options; should it explore more unknown terrain to find new features, or should it revisit known features to improve localisation quality. These options are instantiated into the online path planner for the UAV. We present the SLAM algorithm and evaluate two important properties about the algorithm which assist in developing a path planning module for the UAV. The first of these is the use of the probabilistic measure of "entropy" as an information-based measure of the certainty in the map and vehicle locations, and is used as a utility function for planning the UAVs trajectory and determining the order in which features in the map are observed. The second is an observability analysis of SLAM which presents the unobservable states which are dependent on vehicle maneuvers. The analysis dictates the type of manoeuvres required by the UAV while observing features in order to maintain accurate statistical estimates of the map and vehicle location. This has the effect of reducing the action space that the path planner needs to search over. Using these two properties, we demonstrate an online path planner that intelligently plans the vehicle's trajectory while exploring unknown terrain in order to maximise the quality of both the map and vehicle location. Results of the online path planning algorithm are presented using a 6-DoF simulator of our UAV. The results show that the vehicle localisation errors are constrained and that the number of features and the size of the map steadily grows during the flight. © 2008 IEEE.

T2  - Lecture Notes in Control and Information Sciences
AB  - Electronic chaining is the formation of a linked communication chain that maximizes the end-to-end throughput using a cooperative team of mobile vehicles in an unknown, dynamic environment. A decentralized extremum seeking (ES) controller, which is an adaptive model free controller, is presented to control the locations of the mobile communication relays based on received signal strength, as opposed to relative position. A communication chain that seeks to maximize a link performance metric such as bandwidth or end-to-end delay does not necessarily form a linear, evenly spaced formation of the nodes when jamming and environmental terrain factors are considered. This chapter presents an ES controller that has been specifically designed for use with teams of unmanned aircraft using a Lyapunov guidance vector field controller and in particular focuses on the performance and stability of the ES algorithm due to the operational limits and constraints of an unmanned aircraft. © 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

TI  - Comprehensive navigation analysis for UAVs using COTS
AU  - Craychee, Timothy A.
AB  - As Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play an everincreasing role in intelligence gathering, effective and accurate tools are essential for increasing the probability of overall success and maximizing the benefits of these UAVs. Using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software tools, the user now has the ability to analyze collections plans; navigation quality; threats and jammers; and communications links in pre-mission planning, real-time operations, and post-mission analysis. This COTS technology allows the user to use readily available and proven technology as the basis for breakthrough mission analysis techniques. Details of a mission-aircraft position, orientation, and GPS receiver field-of-view-can be analyzed while considering ground visibility limitations such as terrain obscurations, environmental affects, and duration. Detailed navigation analysis can be calculated modeling all GPS spacecraft parameters as well as end-user hardware including antenna and receiver types. Jammer avoidance and interference can be done in the same software in a 3-D environment depicting threat rings and detection domes. During live operations, the software offers real-time visualization into the aforementioned analysis areas to provide instant insight into the situation as it unfolds. This insight can be used by the warfighter to adapt to new situations and opportunities and to make fast, well-informed decisions. Post-mission, the same type of analysis can be done to compare actual results to the plan. To illustrate these points, a recorded trial will be examined to show this breaktlirough navigation analysis.

TI  - Multi-sensor integration for autonomous vehicle relative navigation
AU  - Vydhyanathan, Arun

AU  - de Haag, Maarten Uijt
AB  - Highly precise relative navigation is the core technology required for many applications such as automated aerial refueling (AAR), sea-based Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS), station-keeping, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarming and formation flight, and unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) convoys. Current relative navigation efforts have centered on carrier-phase differential global positioning system (GPS) integrated with inertial measurement data. Carrier-phase differential GPS may not be available in certain tactical environments and low-cost inertial measurement units (IMUs) may not be able to bridge GPS outages with sufficient accuracy. This paper explores the use of additional sensors (ranging, angular, or combination of both) to improve the integrity and availability of relative navigation solutions. For example, in an AAR scenario there is a possibility of partial GPS signal blockages due to the tanker aircraft; furthermore, there is also a possibility of GPS signal unavailability due to jamming (intentional /unintentional). The additional sensor can be an active and/or passive sensor such as a laser detection and ranging (LADAR) sensor, a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or a scene correlation electro-optical (EO) sensor. The effectiveness of using relative vehicle position and attitude measurements from various sensors is assessed. For example, active sensors may provide accurate range measurements while some passive sensors may only provide relative attitude of the vehicles. The utility of different sensor measurements and integration strategies with baseline GPS/INS are evaluated to meet the requirements for a relative navigation formation flight scenario.

TI  - Emitter geolocation with multiple UAVs
AU  - Okello, Nickens N.
AB  - Geolocation of radar and communication emitters based on time difference of arrivals (TDOAs) can be carried out using a network of three or four unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) each of which is equipped with an electronic warfare support (ES) sensor, a global positioning system (GPS) receiver, a precision clock and a limited bandwidth communication system. When the leading edge of an electromagnetic pulse is detected by an ES sensor on board a given UAV, the time of arrival and the UAVs location are transmitted to a fusion centre. The received measurements from all UAVs within the network are then cross-correlated to determine the time difference of arrivals from which emitter location can estimated. This paper presents two sets of emitter location estimation equations. The first set is for 2-D emitter location estimates for a ground based emitter given time of arrival measurements from three netted UAVs. The second set is for an emitter that is locate at an altitude and gives the complete 3-D location estimation equations given measurements from four netted UAVs. Numerical results based on three and four UAVs are presented to validate these equations.

AB  - Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) represented by GPS and GLONASS is very useful and essential to almost all the field including industries, national defense and security. From these necessities many countries make efforts and investments to have their own navigation systems based on satellite such as Galileo in EU, QZSS in Japan, and Compass in China. These countries still want to have backups to their GNSS whose signal is too weak to be easily interfered. On the other hand, other countries need alternatives since developing the satellite demands immense cost. Rockwell Collins has developed an airborne pseudolite-based Battlefield Navigation System (BNS) which has wide visibility and fast maneuverability. It is, however, only a backup system, not an alternative in a strict sense, because GPS is used to estimate pseudolite's non-fixed position. To improve this backup into an alternative, we should estimate the mobile pseudolite position without the help of GPS. Inverted GPS algorithm was suggested to be independent of the existing GNSS, but some limitations have been obstacles to its wide-use. It is hard to construct a reference pseudolite as high as all the ground stations of wide distribution can see it. Moreover, geometry and observability of the ground stations are critical factors of the system accuracy, so several mobile pseudolites outside the ground network inevitably suffer from huge position error. This paper proposes an airborne transceiver system as an alternative navigation system and triangulation using bidirectional range measurements as a method of transceiver position determination. By canceling out the clock biases via a double-differencing technique, the bidirectional range between two transceivers can be obtained. The ground stations with transceivers, which do not need a common observable pseudolite, can be extended over a huge area, so it is possible to enlarge the coverage of this system as large as a state or a small country. Additionally, mobile transceivers far from the ground network can also get their relatively accurate positions using the airborne pseudolite network, and the position accuracy is less affected by the geometry than that of inverted GPS method. The transceiver navigation system, therefore, is still working in the area where the ground-fixed transceiver stations were not established. We simulated the performance of the suggested regional navigation system using transceivers. We estimated the mobile transceivers' positions using the measurements from the other airborne and the ground-fixed transceiver networks. In this simulation, each airborne transceiver constructed navigation message based on the estimated positions, and then user solved its position receiving signals with the message. We considered a receiver noise and tropospheric error to reflect the reality, and then conducted various case studies. With only ten transceivers (five within the ground-network, the other five outside the network) at the altitude of 40km, the alternative navigation system working in 700km × 900km region is feasible, and its performance can compete that of Galileo's Open Service. This paper will contribute to the alternative or the backup navigation system independent of the GPS with a slim budget in a short development period. The system structure and the position determination algorithm described in this paper are able to be applied to any loading vehicle including high maneuverable UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and stationary airship. Using the simulation result, we can solve the optimal constellations for various operating heights and predict the navigation performance for verifying the system feasibility.

TI  - Geolocation of unmanned aerial vehicles in GPS-degraded environments
AU  - Brown, Aaron S.
AU  - Carter, Danny
AB  - Unmanned systems have become popular for applications such as reconnaissance, surveillance, and even as weapon systems, thus increasing the need to navigate these systems reliably through a variety of environments. For most of these type applications, there is a requirement that the unmanned system be able to determine its location on the earth. Typically, this is accomplished by using the Global Positioning System (GPS), and although GPS is certainly an integral part of modern navigation, there are some instances when it becomes degraded either by the environment or by jamming. Some of the environments that can cause degradation in GPS accuracy include under tree canopies, inside cities between skyscrapers (urban canyons), indoors, and in heavily mountainous terrains. The problem with each of these areas is that GPS signals from some satellites may become attenuated due to the previously mentioned environmental conditions, thus reducing the number of available satellites from which the position may be multilaterated. Also, multipath can produce inaccuracies when in environments with water, glass, or metal, because the GPS signals tend to be reflected causing errors in the distance calculations. In addition to degradation caused by these environmental effects, there are also methods of jamming GPS signals, which can also result in GPS being unavailable or of reduced quality. Because of these problems with GPS, current research is focusing on a method to potentially serve as a complement to the GPS system, particularly for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). This paper provides a description of a method that utilizes a mobile ad-hoc network of nodes, each of which are capable of obtaining ranges to surrounding nodes. The algorithms being studied assume the presence of such ranges, but are independent of the specific ranging technique being utilized, although it would be well suited for a Radio Frequency (RF)-based ranging method. These ranges, along with the positions of some nodes that know their position either by using GPS or another geolocation method, are then used by multilateration techniques to determine the location of the other nodes in the network. While similar methods have been previously implemented, this technique concentrates on ensuring that the network can truly be considered a mobile adhoc network in that all nodes may act as either ranging nodes or receivers, and no nodes are required to be in a fixed position.

AB  - This paper presents results demonstrating real-time six degree of freedom localization, mapping, navigation and obstacle avoidance in an outdoor environment using only a low-cost off-the-shelf inertial measurement unit and a monocular camera. This navigation system is intended for operation of small unmanned aerial vehicles when GPS signals are unavailable due to obstructions or jamming and when operating in cluttered environments such as urban canyons or forests. A small radio-controlled car is used as a test bed. A bearings-only Simultaneous Localization and Mapping algorithm was implemented to localize both the vehicle and obstacles. This paper describes: (a) the hardware used; (b) a two-step approach for data association (image frame to image frame followed by image frame to map); (c) a technique for landmark initialization for the case where landmarks are located on the ground. Hardware test results demonstrating navigation to a goal in an obstacle strewn environment are presented. The effect of unmodelled sensor biases is examined in simulation.

AB  - A growing concept in the field of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) is the idea of using a team of cooperating vehicles to participate in electronic countermeasures, defined here as jamming or deception techniques. A UAV may be tasked to engage a radar using noise jamming to mask its radar return or that of another vehicle. Similarly, a UAV may be assigned to deceive a radar by directing a delayed signal toward the victim radar, which has the effect of producing a radar phantom perceived by the radar as an object at a false range and/or bearing. Previous work focused on generating a set of waypoints for the UAV to follow in order for the countermeasures to be successful. This paper addresses the path planning required to meet the temporal, spatial, and UAV flight dynamics constraints associated with employing these electronic countermeasures, especially between jamming and deception activities. The UAVs are assigned simplified flight dynamics and performance constraints in two-dimensions, assuming constant altitude flight over a flat-surfaced earth. All tracking radars are given simplified detection properties. A single UAV is provided a pre-determined series of "goal positions." The goal positions may lie along a countermeasure's pre-planned course or they may be established such that the UAV moves from the final waypoint of one countermeasure to the starting point of the next countermeasure. Therefore the UAV must autonomously navigate to a given goal position, subsequently perform a simple, associated task (countermeasure, if required), then navigate to the next goal position in the series. The UAVs will be required to arrive at these waypoints with a specific state, depending on the task at hand. Algorithms for optimal autonomous navigation of this nature were formulated to effectively guide the UAVs to their goal positions to meet the necessary temporal and spatial requirements. Simulations were generated to test the path-planning and control strategies given UAV/radar network scenarios, and overall UAV navigational performance in each simulation was analyzed.

TI  - A global positioning system (GPS) interference electronics support measure (ESM) payload system for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
AU  - Wurth, Timothy J.

AB  - Modern battlefields depend on GPS for precision navigation and timing. Unfortunately, GPS signals are very-low level and GPS interference, both intentional and unintentional, can severely degrade GPS performance. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), which have proven their value on the battlefield, rely heavily on GPS for navigation and flight integrity. Key to continued mission success for UAVs is enhanced anti-jamming capabilities. A revealing test of anti-jamming performance for a UAV is to maintain GPS synchronization, while accurately locating a GPS jammer. A small, modular ESM payload is needed to supply anti-jamming performance for the UAV and secondarily, to use DF techniques to locate the GPS jammer. This paper investigates a small, low-power, low-cost, modular solution to reducing the vulnerability to jamming of UAVs by leveraging commercial off-the-shelf technology. A miniaturized GPS antenna configuration that both lowers susceptibility to GPS jamming, and also allows accurate determination of the GPS jammer's location, is presented. This GPS antenna arrangement consists of two GPS antenna arrays, one positioned on the top of the UAV (facing skyward) and one positioned on the underside of the UAV (facing the ground). The top antenna array acquires and tracks a minimum of 4 GPS satellites for accurate positioning and timing. The bottom antenna array is used to detect and locate GPS interference, and in coordination with the top array, limits susceptibility to GPS interference. The first action upon detecting GPS interference is to alter the reception pattern of the top GPS antenna array to reduce the amount of interference processed by the GPS receiver. Simultaneously, sampled data from both antenna arrays are used to monitor the effect of the interference and calculate the position of the jammer.

AB  - In this work, we present an architecture and algorithmic framework where topographic and nontopographic computation is combined on the basis of several artificial neural network models. The algorithm cores utilize an analogic (analog and logical) architecture consisting of a high resolution optical sensor, a low resolution cellular sensorprocessor (cellular nonlinear network - CNN - based chip) and a digital signal processor. The proposed framework makes the acquisition of a spatially and temporally consistent image flow possible even in case of extreme variations in the environment. It ideally supports the handling of difficult problems on a moving platform such as terrain identification, navigation parameter estimation and multi-target tracking. The proposed spatio-temporal adaptation relies on a feature based optical flow estimation that can be efficiently calculated on available CNN chips. We will illustrate how multi-channel visual flow analysis and classifier (ART, KN) driven visual attention-selection mechanisms can be efficiently supported by an analogic architecture. The experiments performed on an analogic CNN hardware prototype will highlight some of the application potentials for unmanned air vehicle (UAV) applications.

AB  - Global Positioning System (GPS) has clearly emerged as a fundamental utility with widespread private and commercial civilian applications. Many of these applications are directly related to safety-of-life uses such as all-weather aircraft precision approach and landing, ship navigation in restricted waters, and emergency response vehicle tracking and management. GPS has significantly improved efficiency in commercial applications such as truck, train, and even, individual container tracking and dispatch. There is a similar dependency within the military - not only in vehicle navigation - but also hi areas such as precision weapon guidance and "blue force" tracking. This dependency on GPS has brought significant attention on the potential for an asymmetric vulnerability on this low signal power radio navigation system. Threat systems to GPS exist, are commercially available, and have been used in combat. The technology is not complex, and even simple, low-cost systems could cause significant GPS denial. Furthermore, as other Global Navigation Satellite Systems gain maturity and widespread use, one can easily imagine the threat expanding to cover those systems as well. Herein, we describe a project directed by Congress, starting in 1997, to develop the capability to detect and locate sources of unintentional interference and intentional jamming, and to assess the effectiveness and utility of such a system. Under this project, SPAWAR and FALON, Inc. have successfully developed and demonstrated a prototype system small enough to be compatible with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles named Location of GPS Interferers (LOCO GPSI). The LOCO GPSI system employs short baseline antenna interferometry and a highly sensitive, rapidly scanning receiver to detect and precisely Direction Find (DF) the interference source. Interference source location is determined by triangulating successive DF lines of position. Ground and flight demonstration results suggest that performance objectives have been met.

AU  - Yoo, Changsun
AU  - Ahn, Ieeki
AB  - The performance of UAV is dependant greatly upon onboard sensors due to its characteristics of unmanned operated vehicle. The navigation sensor, which informs where UAV is flying, also is one of those onboard sensors. Small UAV needs the navigation system with the compact, light, cheap and precise navigation solution. As the inertial sensor for precise air navigation is very expensive, it is not popular in small aircraft and UAV. While GPS services a seamless navigation with cheap receiver, it may not receive the satellite signal by the obstacle or the signal jamming. It is GPS/INS sensor fusion that might overcome these constraints. GPS receiver on air vehicle may happen to lose the signal in a dynamic environment such as aircraft maneuver. The multiple GPS antennas were used to increase the coverage of GPS receiver. The ground test showed that GPS/INS sensor fusion system could provide well the attitude information as well as the trajectory according to a vehicle movement.

AB  - Autonomous unmanned air vehicle flight control systems require robust path generation to account for terrain obstructions, weather, and moving threats such as radar, jammers, and unfriendly aircraft. In this paper, we outline a feasible, hierarchal approach for real-time motion planning of small autonomous fixed-wing UAVs. The approach divides the trajectory generation into four tasks: waypoint path planning, dynamic trajectory smoothing, trajectory tracking, and low-level autopilot compensation. The waypoint path planner determines the vehicle's route without regard for the dynamic constraints of the vehicle. This results in a significant reduction in the path search space, enabling the generation of complicated paths that account for pop-up and dynamically moving threats. Kinematic constraints are satisfied using a trajectory smoother which has the same kinematic structure as the physical vehicle. The third step of the approach uses a novel tracking algorithm to generate a feasible state trajectory that can be followed by a standard autopilot. Monte-Carlo simulations were done to analyze the performance and feasibility of the approach and determine real-time computation requirements. A planar version of the algorithm has also been implemented and tested in a low-cost micro-controller. The paper describes a custom UAV built to test the algorithms. © 2003 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) require avionics systems that enable them to maintain a stable attitude and to follow a desired flight path. This paper considers the design and development of such an avionics system that provides navigational and terrain information to the flight computer of a rotorcraft UAV. The process includes the design and testing of flight hardware and software that interprets sensor data. The paper provides an overview of a specific implementation of the approach: the GTMax testbed developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology UAV Research Facility. Its available payload and performance allows for a variety of onboard sensors, supports reconfiguration, and has the capability to demonstrate aggressive maneuvers under complex and changing mission scenarios. First, the hardware selection and integration process will be outlined. The design factors include weight, electromagnetic interference, vibration, flexibility, hardware integration, redundancy, maintainability, and growth potential. Sensor data from multiple sources is filtered and integrated/fused into a navigation solution. Before actual flight tests take place, sensor interfaces and navigation algorithms are verified to ensure proper functioning. By using software emulated sensor data and a simulation model of the aircraft, the algorithms are first tested. The same test is then repeated on the actual flight computer by feeding simulated sensor data from a computer that is running a simulation model of the vehicle and sensors. The navigation system is then tested on the ground in an automobile, and then on the helicopter. Ground and flight-test data showing sensor and navigation system performance are compared to simulation results.

TI  - Universal Drone System and electronic intelligence gathering operations
AU  - Wells, Dan M.
AB  - The electronic warfare capability of the U.S. Military has reached a level of sophistication such that enemy forces now de-activate their air defense artillery (ADA) radar systems to prevent their detection and destruction. Once an engagement has begun, the ADA systems are activated and can search, track, and acquire attacking aircraft such as Army scout and attack helicopters. Detection and elimination of these ADA sites prior to an engagement would allow the scout and attack aircraft to concentrate on other, high priority, hard targets. The Universal Drone System (UDS) is a remotely-piloted AH-1S with certain autonomous flight capabilities. With the addition of several software modes and a navigation system, the UDS could be employed as a sacrificial target in order to activate opposing force ADA radar systems. Once the radar systems search and acquire the drone attack helicopter, their position can be determined using U.S. Army Aerial Exploitation Battalion assets. Long range artillery can then be used to suppress the ADA. This combination of forces would give a Corps Commander an internal ability to detect and destroy the ADA that threatens Corps aviation assets.

TI  - Blind adaptive interference rejection based on Doppler/delay diversity between desired signal & interferences/clutters
AU  - Wong, Kainam Thomas
AB  - This blind adaptive interference rejection algorithm aims to null multiple smart jammers and background clutters impinging from unknown azimuths and elevations using a sensor array with unknown or uncalibrated array manifold. This algorithm, by exploiting the Doppler diversity and delay diversity amongst the desired signal and interferences, separately estimates the spatial correlation matrix (R<inf>I+N</inf>) encompassing only the interference and noise and the spatial correlation matrix (R<inf>S+I+N</inf>) encompassing the desired signal plus interferences and noise. The eigenvector corresponding to the largest generalized eigenvalue of the matrix pencil pair R<inf>+I+N</inf>,R<inf>I+N</inf> represents the optimum adaptive beamforming weight vector w° that will maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). This alternate ISR (intelligence/surveillance/reconnaissance) technology could lower the cost and may enhance the reliability of existing sensor-array adaptive beamforming technology in pulse radar systems, in military and commercial Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation devices, and in UAV electronic surveillance systems.

AB  - Many advances in inertial navigation have been made over the last decade. Small, lightweight inertial measurement units (IMU) have been developed which provide suitable accuracy at a reasonable cost for many unmanned systems. Price has also dropped to previously unheard of levels (under 10,000 dollars for large buys). IMUs can be augmented with global positioning system (GPS) receivers to provide highly accurate and robust navigation capability. GPS receivers have also dropped in size and cost and are becoming an attractive option for coupling with an inertial system. GPS systems alone are vulnerable to jamming and are not a good choice for military applications where jamming is a consideration. Current Army policy is not to use GPS as a mission essential element. The focus of this paper will be on low cost IMUs with GPS and their application to unmanned vehicles. In particular, the program to add guidance to the multiple launch rocket system extended range rocket will be discussed.

TI  - Multimode image-based navigation for unmanned aerial vehicle
AU  - Venkateswarlu, Ronda
AB  - Autonomous navigation of a small, slow speed, low altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) have many potential applications. UAVs are generally used for (i) remote sensing the areas which are difficult to approach, (ii) surveillance, (iii) target designation or jamming, (iv) weapon delivery or as a weapon by itself, etc. Another potential application would be to use them a cost-effective loitering vehicles near the potential enemy sites, creating nuisance value. In most applications, the solution for autonomous navigation is to install inertial navigation systems (INS) on board the flight vehicle and regularly update the INS as often and as accurately as possible. In this paper, different INS updating techniques are briefly mentioned with their advantages and drawbacks, and then a multi-mode image based navigation is proposed. Using several body mounted focal-plane-array imaging sensors, a bigger image is obtained to get sufficient features for matching. The emphasis in this paper is to get vehicle's speed, direction/attitude, and 'running fixes' by using very reliable 'area correlation' tracking. A combination of feature based scene matching along with area correlation is proposed for updating INS. The effort in this paper is to bring out conceptual ideas of image based navigation to make an UAV to perform better and at the same time cost effective.

AB  - A new standard of lightweight, low cost, integrated GPS/INS products has been created with the introduction of Rockwell's family of MIGITS<sup>TM</sup> (Miniature Integrated GPS/INS Tactical System) products. This family takes full advantage of the precision pseudorange and pseudorange rate information available only from an embedded GPS receiver. This information is integrated with inertial data in a single Kalman filter in a synergistic manner which results in superior operation in high dynamic, antenna shading, and jamming environments. As this paper will show, the Rockwell MIGITS has successfully demonstrated ability to tightly couple a tactical grade IMU with GPS to provide precise navigation operation in a dynamic environment. As the primary supplier of GPS user equipment to the military, Rockwell International has played a pioneering role in the development and success of GPS. The introduction of the integrated GPS/INS system advances the evolution of strapdown inertial systems and stand-alone GPS receivers that began over 20 years ago. Rockwell's Collins Avionics & Communications Division (CACD) established itself in the pursuit of integrated systems with leadership in the development of both stand-alone and integrated GPS systems during the technology's infancy in the early seventies, and has continued to help advance the state of the art to where it is today. GPS receivers have continued to advance largely through a decrease in size as well as improved performance in a variety of environments such as jamming. The integrated systems described in this paper build upon the lessons learned and the continued evolution of GPS. Continual refinements in research and development programs at Rockwell have led to this family of small integrated systems, resulting in what we believe is the world's smallest, integrated GPS/INS systems available today, the MIGITS. The MIGITS products are intended to satisfy navigation requirements of a variety of application including missiles, both fixed and rotary aircraft, UAV's, munitions, targets and drones. paper provides an introduction to the qq MIGITS systems, followed by a description qq system testing performed thus far.
