  abstract={The communications quality of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been brought into focus increasingly, which can be severely affected by other users, as well as complex topography. In this letter, we propose a path planning algorithm for UAV anti-jamming communications with the joint assistance of two kinds of radio maps—signal power map and signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) map, which contain the abundant information of path loss caused by the topography and interference from jammers. We show how to generate these maps from real topographic data, and provide the optimal UAV path planning by adopting the power and the SNR maps to the heuristic and graphic based A* algorithm. Simulations with various settings for areas with complex topography in real world, show that the proposed algorithm can considerably improve the efficiency by minimizing the UAV flying distance for anti-jamming communications.},

  abstract={An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided network is becoming a promising application for the future wireless communication due to the flexible deployment and dominant line-of-sight channel. In this paper, we consider the UAV is operated as a cooperative jammer to enhance the physical layer security of the ground legitimated nodes in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). Furthermore, we assume that the UAV has imperfect information on the locations of the receiver and Eve due to GPS jamming and covert operation of Eve, respectively. With these uncertainties of the nodes' locations, we formulate a robust joint optimization problem of the UAV's jamming power and trajectory to maximize the average secrecy rate. To handle the non-convexity of the optimization problem, we propose an iterative suboptimal algorithm based on the block coordinate descent method. Simulation results present that the proposed algorithm has outstanding performance in terms of physical layer security compared to other benchmark methods.},

  abstract={Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used in wireless communication network due to the advantages of low cost, high mobility and effective deployment. However, complex environment, fading effect and the openness of wireless channel limit the quality of wireless communications, making the communication system vulnerable to jamming attack. In this paper, an anti-jamming UAV communication scheme is developed, in which a UAV is deployed to transmit data to multiple ground user devices under jamming environment. We consider the UAV as a mobile base station, which flies within a target area with several jamming sources in it, and keeps providing wireless communication service from the air via air-to-ground downlink. In addition, we assume that the UAV has limited energy capacity. By applying a deep reinforcement learning based algorithm, the UAV learns from the scheme and spontaneously determines an optimal anti-jamming communication policy that jointly controls the trajectory and power of the UAV. Simulation results shows that the proposed scheme can improve energy efficiency while maintaining a relatively high level of signal-to-interference-plus- noise ratio (SINR) in data transmission tasks.},

  abstract={The “black flight” problem is seriously threatening the security of critical areas, and developing effective countermeasures is an urgent need in both military and civilian domains. However, the anti-jamming of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) continues to evolve, and traditional countermeasure systems face challenges such as low jamming success rates and poor flexibility, making it difficult to meet the demands of defense and confrontation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a jamming method for UAV communication and navigation signals. Based on the YunSDR-Y550 software-defined radio platform, we developed the UAV_ATK upper computer interface software to communicate in real-time with the hardware platform, adjusting power, frequency bands, and bandwidth. We generate three modes of signal disruption—broadband jamming, comb jamming, and frequency sweeping jamming—to disrupt the UAV's telemetry link. We also disrupt the UAV's navigation link by jamming GPS and BDS navigation signals. By mimicking real GPS signals and generating false navigation messages, we gradually lead the receiver tracking loop to lock onto the deceptive signal, achieving intrusive deception of the UAV. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method.},

  abstract={With the widespread application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the issue of path planning has become increasingly significant in search of suitable paths for UAVs. However, positioning errors may exist in the system carried by the UAV in practical situations, leading to the suboptimal or even unsafe path execution. In view of this, we construct the multi-UAV robust path planning model under position uncertainty by incorporating several important considerations. This can be expressed as a complicated robust optimization problem, aiming to obtain a robust optimal path for each UAV in the presence of positioning errors. Based on this, we introduce the corresponding overall cost function and its expected expression for robust evaluation. Then, we propose a novel robust particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which employs the scale-free topology to characterize the individual interactions in the swarm. And an improved explicit sampling technique is developed by introducing a sampling coefficient, where the number of samples increases proportional to the degree value for a particle in PSO, allowing effective robustness evaluation for each solution. The proposed algorithm shows great advantages on benchmark functions, compared with some other robust PSO algorithms. Further, we present the specific implementation of the multi-UAV robust path planning method based on the proposed algorithm. Finally, simulation experiments on various path planning scenarios and comparison results indicate the superiority of the developed method, which can plan a robust and effective path for each UAV.},

  abstract={This letter presents a new approach to enhance the anti-jamming capability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless data collection, specifically addressing the challenge of multi-jammers attacks in the context of imperfect channel state information (CSI). The proposed approach is designed for a scenario where a single UAV is responsible for collecting data from multiple ground sensors, while encountering multi-jammers from a ground-based adversary. The objective is to maximize the average data rate of all sensors while ensuring a sufficient amount of data is collected from each sensor. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-convex problem, and successive convex approximation(SCA) technique is employed, which jointly optimizes the collection schedule, power control and UAV trajectory. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms in the presence of interference and imperfect CSI.},

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate the UAV-UAV communication system, wherein a source UAV transmits signals to a destination UAV in the presence of a malicious jammer. We aim to minimize the flight time by optimizing the trajectory of UAVs with limited turning angle subject to the required minimum information to be transmitted. However, the formulated problem is non-convex and intractable to solve. Thus, we propose an iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to solve it with the aid of Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and Young inequality. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can provide corresponding trajectory design with different jammer's deployment, and the freer turning angle along with the fewer required transmitted information can lead to shorter flight time.},

  abstract={Wireless communications involving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are more vulnerable to the malicious jamming. As a promising solution, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can be equipped on the UAVs to achieve anti-jamming transmissions by leveraging the reconfigurable passive beamforming technique. In this paper, we study a wireless communication system where a UAV carries an IRS and acts as a mobile relay for a multi-antenna transmitter and receiver pair in the presence of a smart jammer that transmits jamming signals to the receiver and the IRS simultaneously. By jointly designing the transmit beamformer, IRS reflection phase, and UAV trajectory, we aim to maximize the average achievable rate over the entire flight with effective resistance to jamming attacks. To solve the non-convex problem, we adopt the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm and decompose the problem into two subproblems, i.e., joint optimization of the transmit beamformer and reflection phase for a specific time slot and optimization of the UAV trajectory. Simulation results show that the proposed joint optimization framework can well combat the jammer under various network settings such as changing the position of the jammer and the initial position of the UAV. The proposed algorithm has good convergence and achieves better performance than other benchmark schemes.},

In our proposed design, we take the users' mobility and the jammer's adaptive jamming power into consideration and model the UAV's trajectory as a Markov decision process. Then, with the goal of optimizing the overall average throughput in our system, we design a twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient-based algorithm to judiciously optimize the trajectory of the UAV in a continuous manner, while simultaneously satisfying practical constraints on both the UAV's and users' mobility. We compare the performance of our proposed design with various baselines and show how it can improve the average throughput performance in the presence of malicious jamming and converge at a faster rate.},

  abstract={In this paper, we consider an anti-jamming problem for one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) reaching a given destination with maintaining the communication quality, where the ground-to-air communication link is spatially affected by an adversarial jammer. Note that the jammer's position and transmit power are initially unknown. To solve this problem, we propose a jammer detection-localization-evasion framework. Firstly, we employ a jammer detection method combining the Received Signal Strength (RSS) with Packet Error Rate (PER). After the jammer is detected, our designed RSS based jammer localization algorithm is presented, which can estimate the jammer position and jamming signal power simultaneously. However, localization noises often exist in practical scenarios, and therefore the estimated jammer information is usually with uncertainties. To overcome these uncertainties, we propose a robust path planning method of successful jammer evasion. More specifically, the proposed method can guarantee the worst-case performance so that the communication quality can be always better than a certain level under all possible uncertainties. Finally, a UAV communication jammed model is built on Network Simulator (NS3) and corroborates the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled air-ground integrated communication systems are vulnerable to jamming attack, mainly due to the high probability with line-of-sight wireless channel conditions. Although a few UAV anti-jamming transmission schemes have been recently proposed, the fundamental performance limits by simultaneously considering the UAV and jammer’s mobility have not yet been reported. These observations motivate us to formulate an interactive reward region (IRR) characterization problem for the scenario that the UAV and the jammer compete with each other to maximize their respective rewards via power and mobility control. Then, we propose a transmit and jamming power optimization algorithm to characterize the IRR with power control, by leveraging successive convex approximation technique, where two transmit power design schemes are given in closed-form expressions from a game-theoretic perspective. Furthermore, the IRR with joint power and mobility control is characterized based on alternating optimization, in which both the UAV and jammer can simultaneously adjust their power and trajectories. Finally, extensive simulation results reveal that joint transmit power and trajectory optimization can enlarge the IRR, and increasing the UAV mobility and flight time length improves the UAV reward.},

  abstract={As the cost and technical difficulty of jamming devices continue to decrease, jamming has become one of the major threats to positioning service. Unfortunately, most conventional wireless positioning technologies are vulnerable to jamming attacks due to inherent shortcomings like weak signal strength and unfavorable anchor geometry. Thanks to their high operational flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could be a promising solution to the above challenges. Therefore, in this article, we propose a UAV-assisted anti-jamming positioning system, in which multiple UAVs first utilize time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) measurements from ground reference stations and double-response two-way ranging (DR-TWR) measurements from UAV-to-UAV links to perform self-localization as well as clock synchronization, and then act as anchor nodes to provide TDoA positioning service for ground users in the presence of jamming. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed system, we first derive the Cramér-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of UAV self-localization. Then, the impacts of UAV position uncertainty and synchronization errors caused by jamming on positioning service are modeled, and the theoretical root-mean-square error (RMSE) of user position estimate is further derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system is a promising alternative to existing positioning systems when their services are disrupted by jamming. The most notable advantage of the proposed system is that it is fully compatible with existing user equipment terminals and positioning methods.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) plays an important role in fifth and sixth (5G/6G) communication systems, garnering significant research attention. This paper investigates a dynamic UAV-enabled secure ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) system, where a UAV sends confidential data to a mobile device where another UAV cooperatively transmits jamming interference to confuse a potential eavesdropper. The transmission latency constraint, secure communication requirement and dynamic channel characteristics are considered into real-word communication environments. Then, a joint communication transmit power, jamming power, and trajectory optimization approach is proposed to maximize the system secrecy rate, simultaneously guaranteeing the URLLC requirement. To effectively address the non-convex problem, the URLLC constraint is transformed into a data rate constraint to ensure that the optimization problem is more manageable, and then present an efficient solution by employing an alternating approximation and successive convex optimization. Finally, simulation results verify that the presented joint optimization approach substantially outperforms other popular benchmarks in secrecy rate performance.},

  abstract={Drones have found extensive use in military applications owing to their inconspicuousness and easy deployment. Major challenges in the UAV space today include: (a) Maintaining seamless connectivity with the ground station to maintain command and control (C2) link and ensure continuous streaming of high quality data and (b) avoiding enroute RF jammers that can saturate the RF receiver and inhibit communication. Additionally, GNSS jammers can render drones completely nonfunctional by not allowing the drone to communicate with GPS satellites to ascertain their location. This work addresses these two challenges by developing a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that is able to optimize the wireless connectivity while avoiding jammers along the drone route. Notably, the algorithm ensures minimal deviation from the planned path in the presence of jammers. The training process for the drone can be completely accomplished pre-flight. The drone is only required to carry a lookup table (Q-table) during flight thereby reducing the computing requirements onboard the drone.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely applied in internet-of-things (IoT) scenarios while the security for UAV communications remains a challenging problem due to the broadcast nature of the line-of-sight (LoS) wireless channels. This article investigates the security problems for dual UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, where one UAV is invoked to help the ground terminal devices (TDs) to compute the offloaded tasks and the other one acts as a jammer to suppress the vicious eavesdroppers. In our framework, minimum secure computing capacity maximization problems are proposed for both the time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme by jointly optimizing the communication resources, computation resources, and UAVs' trajectories. The formulated problems are non-trivial and challenging to be solved due to the highly coupled variables. To tackle these problems, we first transform them into more tractable ones then a block coordinate descent based algorithm and a penalized block coordinate descent based algorithm are proposed to solve the problems for TDMA and NOMA schemes, respectively. Finally, numerical results show that the security computing capacity performance of the systems is enhanced by the proposed algorithms as compared with the benchmarks. Meanwhile, the NOMA scheme is superior to the TDMA scheme for security improvement.},

In this paper, we investigate the optimization of the UAV flight path in a wireless relay communication system, when a jamming or interference signal is present. The UAV flight path is optimized to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), and the required parameters are estimated. The simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve performance close to an ideal SINR optimization and also highlight the benefits of optimizing the SINR instead of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when a jamming or interference signal is present.},

  abstract={Jamming is a form of the Denial of Service (J-DoS) attack. It is a significant threat that causes malfunction in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle systems, especially when used in hostile environments. The attackers mainly operate in the wireless communication environment by following a few preexisting scenarios. In this paper, we propose an idea for a Jamming detection mechanism. The mechanism utilizes the network parameters available to the system and some additional measures to distinguish between bad transmission quality and Jamming to avoid false positive alarms. After detecting a Jamming attack, appropriate countermeasures or mitigation techniques can be applied to keep the system safe.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are vulnerable to a number of threats, including jamming. Jamming is the act of intentionally directing electromagnetic energy towards a communication and / or navigation system to disrupt or prevent signal transmission and reception. Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) jammers transmit interference signals in the frequency band used for satellite navigation. Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) filter as a potential solution to mitigate the jamming activity. The effectiveness of FSS depends on the incidence angle of the jamming signals. It is important to characterize the GPS performance of the UAV in the absence of the FSS filter, which will be used as a benchmark for modelling the appropriate FSS filter. Hence, this paper aims to investigate preliminary effects of jamming signal on UAV. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of Global Positioning System (GPS) jamming on UAVs based on two different conditions, namely, varying times and rotation angles. The study was conducted using GPS simulation in an anechoic chamber to prevent external interferences and multipath. Different estimated probable error (EPE) patterns are observed at different times due to the GPS satellite constellation being dynamic. This indicates that GPS accuracy is time-dependent. The results also show that the presence of a jammer imposes a significant effect on GPS accuracy when the jammer signal reaches -89 dBm. The significance of this work is to provide a solution to prevent GPS jamming and ensure safe and reliable UAV navigation by using a frequency selective surface (FSS) filter for future work.},

  abstract={Large unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) performs reconnaissance and data collection missions against hostile jamming in satellite-UAV coordination Networks. In this case, the ground base station (BS) is unable to provide access service to the UAV, thus the UAV has to rely on information support from the satellite communication system. Low earth orbit (LEO) satellites provide access beams for UAVs, and the UAV transmits the collected data to the satellite via uplink. Due to the unknown and uncertain environment, it is difficult for large UAV to get an effective planned flight trajectory, and the presence of malicious jamming further exacerbates the complexity of trajectory control. To address this problem, a reinforcement learning (RL) based trajectory control approach is proposed to explore the unknown jamming environment and realize autonomous trajectory planning. Finally, the simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

In this paper, first of all, we use the received signal strength (RSSI) and the signal-to-intensity ratio (SINR) to jointly construct the communication potential field on the cluster flight trajectory and the local communication potential field at the cluster location, under the assumption of stable communication signals within the cluster. Next, we estimate the direction of the unknown interference source relative to the cluster's location according to the communication potential field. And finally, we establish the repulsive field of the jamming source as well as the attractive field of the target point. Then we use the artificial potential field algorithm to plan a trajectory with high communication quality for the cluster. The simulation shows that the method can reduce the communication loss between UAV and ground station under the communication interference environment.},

  abstract={As drone technologies become more abundant, efficient and robust, path planning has become increasingly necessary. For ease of use, Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) applications have been developed to simplify the user experience and ensure efficient navigation. These applications enhance the drone's ability to perform various tasks, such as surveillance, delivery, and photography, with reliability and precision. This paper presents an innovative Human-Drone-Interface (HDI) designed to simplify the navigation of drones along user-defined paths. Drone flight paths can be defined by drawing routes or specifying Points of Interest (POIs) on a digital map, streamlining the user experience for users. This work addresses the hardware and software challenges of interpreting user-defined paths in real time, optimizing the drone's route, and generating precise flight commands. Algorithmic computations are delegated to the cloud to enhance battery efficiency. The system incorporates the Long Range (LoRa) protocol to communicate with the drone, which enables a more extended range of operations while providing reliable connectivity in areas with poor coverage and limited broadband access. By making drones easier to operate, the proposed solution seeks to make drones more widely accessible, thus pushing the boundaries of user-friendly drone navigation. Testing results demonstrated the HDI's robust ability to consistently instruct drones along user-defined paths. This capability makes it well-suited for real-world applications such as agriculture, where precise navigation is essential for irrigation or delivery systems, where path optimization ensures timely delivery of nackages.},

  abstract={This paper designs a scenario for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to assist in telecommunication tower inspection. There are opportunities for further exploration in several areas: 1) Comprehensive practical constraints should be considered; 2) Strong or intelligent attacks should be considered; 3) Single-UAV scenarios should not be the only scenarios considered. This paper focuses on a task where a swarm of UAVs fly within a certain space to inspect the signal strength of telecommunication towers, while also introducing intelligent interference attacks. Specifically, the UAV swarm needs to use a path planning algorithm with excellent robustness to counter this intelligent jamming attack, complete inspection from multiple telecommunication towers, and reach the destination within a specified time limit, while satisfying various practical constraints, including kinematic constraints, no-fly zone constraints, and task deadline constraints. This paper adopts the Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm from Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to solve this problem. This work gradually illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of defense measures in scenarios with no jamming attacks, fixed jamming attacks, and intelligent jamming attacks.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are anticipated to be a potential data collection solution for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The main challenges of integrating UAVs in WSNs are security threats and UAV’s onboard energy limitation. To cope with these two challenges, this article examines the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problem in UAV-enabled WSN. Specifically, a full-duplex (FD) UAV gathers confidential information from ground sensor nodes (SNs) in the uplink while sending jamming signals to confound a ground eavesdropper (Eve) in the downlink. Considering a passive eavesdropping scenario lacking Eve’s instantaneous channel state information (CSI), the resulting problem is subject to the constraints of connection outage probability (COP), secrecy outage probability (SOP), securely collected bits, and flight trajectory. To tackle the intractable nonconvex problem, we first derive the optimal codeword rate and redundancy rate in closed-form expressions and then develop a low-complexity algorithm using the block coordinate descent (BCD) approach to alternatively optimize the SN scheduling, SN transmit power, UAV transmit power, and UAV trajectory. Simulation results verify the performance gains of the proposed scheme compared with the benchmark schemes. In particular, the proposed scheme achieves nearly the same secrecy rate gains at a lower UAV’s energy consumption cost than the sum secrecy rate maximization (SSRM) baseline. Moreover, it is revealed that trajectory optimization of the proposed scheme plays a crucial role in improving SEE performance compared with the circle trajectory (CT) baseline.},

  abstract={The act of deliberately directing electromagnetic energy towards a communication and/or navigation system with the purpose to interrupt or inhibit signal transmission and reception is known as jamming. Jamming is used to send high signal to disrupt the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) communication and force the UAVs to land. This prevents the operator from receiving UAV, which results in the UAV losing control. Jamming activity may present a substantial threat to the communication security of the country especially for military. A Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) filter is the alternative option to mitigate jamming activity. The FSS filter has several benefits such as effective performance in term of having high bandwidth and high transmission, low-cost and lightweight material which is suitable to be implemented for UAVs. In this paper, we investigate the performance of proposed FSS bandpass filter using Ansys software simulation at 2.4 GHz. The Ansys Software is used to design the band pass filter in a simple square shape by varying several parameters such as element length ($a$), width of aperture ($b$) and periodic length ($c$). A complete design and analysis of the proposed FSS square filter is based on the reflection coefficient S11 and transmission coefficient S21 are presented in this paper. The transmission of the filter is 97%. In conclusion, the proposed dimension of the square unit cell that can filter out the jamming signal for small UAV size is 38 mm, aperture width is 2.9 mm and the periodic length is 60 mm.},

  abstract={This letter investigates the physical layer security issue in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks. Specifically, two UAVs transmit confidential messages to their specified ground destinations by sharing the same spectrum, while a ground eavesdropper attempts to wiretap the confidential messages. In the considered scenario, although mutual interferences arising from spectrum sharing may lower the spectral efficiency, the overhearing effect may also be alleviated as these two UAVs inherently act as cooperative jammers for each other. Motivated by this, a cooperation strategy is designed to combat eavesdropping, so that the system secrecy rate can be maximized. To this end, an iterative algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the trajectory and transmit power of both UAVs. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed scheme can achieve significant secrecy rate gain in comparison with the benchmarks.},

  abstract={With more and more distributed deployment of Internet of Things (IoTs) in 5/6G networks, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted much interest for mobile edge computing service outside the coverage of terrestrial cellular systems. However, due to the interference and coverage hole issues of UAV-assisted aerial 3D communications, how to design a suitable UAV trajectory is crucial for the performance of future 6G-UAV. In order to achieve a balance between the communication quality and mission accomplishment, we define an environmental model with random interference and formulate a trajectory optimization problem to improve the communication coverage performance in high mobility conditions. By setting an interference point in the highly dynamic networks, we propose a novel trajectory optimization algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to minimize the overall task execution delay and expected outage duration. The received data information of UAVs is used for double deep $q$-network (DDQN) training while the prioritized empirical replay architecture in the prioritized replay deep $q$ network (DQN) is utilized to select the best UAV action, avoid the UAV flying into the random interference points, and reduce the random interference.

  abstract={Satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have been introduced as enhanced approaches to provide dynamic control, massive connections and global coverage for future wireless communication systems. This paper considers a coordinated satellite-UAV communication system, where the UAV performs the environmental reconnaissance task with the assistance of satellites in a hostile jamming environment. To fulfill this task, the UAV needs to realize autonomous trajectory control and upload the collected data to the satellite. With the aid of the uploading data, the satellite builds the environment situation map integrating the beam quality, jamming status, and traffic distribution. Accordingly, we propose a closed-loop anti-jamming dynamic trajectory optimization approach, which is divided into three stages. Firstly, a coarse trajectory planning is made according to the limited prior information and preset points. Secondly, the flight control between two adjacent preset points is formulated as a Markov decision process, and reinforcement learning (RL) based automatic flying control algorithms are proposed to explore the unknown hostile environment and realize autonomous and precise trajectory control. Thirdly, based on the collected data during the UAV’s flight, the satellite utilizes an environment situation estimating algorithm to build an environment situation map, which is used to reselect the preset points for the first stage and provide better initialization for the RL process in the second stage. Simulation results verify the validity and superiority of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={Recently the proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has emerged as a pressing concern, attributed to the accessibility of capable drones and the surge in incidents involving unauthorized UAVs flying over restricted areas, such as airports, stadiums, military bases, etc. Consequently, the development and deployment of drone jamming techniques have been proposed to address this evolving threat, particularly by law enforcement agencies. However, these jamming technologies require high transmitted power and risk interference with other communications operating within the same industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band. This paper introduces a smart jamming technique to neutralize UAVs threats. The proposed approach uses radio frequency (RF) analysis and deep learning techniques to identify the drone model and generate tailored jamming signals to minimize overall power consumption to neutralize the target drone. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms other jamming techniques. The proposed approach attains successful jamming at low jammer-to-signal ratios (JSR) as compared to other jammers, as a result, less transmitted power is required to reach the same jamming performance as the other jamming technique.},

  abstract={With the rapid popularity of autonomous aerial vehicles (AAV)-Internet of Things (IoT) networks, timely and energy-efficient data collection is a critical issue. The strong Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication of UAVs makes them more susceptible to jamming attacks, resulting in increased communication latency and energy consumption (EC). In this article, the problem of jointly minimizing Age of Information (AoI) and EC in data collection under malicious jamming attacks is formulated by optimizing the diagonal phase shift matrix of the intelligent reflective surface (IRS), UAV trajectory, and the transmit powers of IoT devices. The formulated problem is solved by an alternating optimization (AO) scheme. Specifically, we first obtain the closed-form solution of the IRS diagonal phase shift matrix by using the quantitative passive beamforming method. Then, the UAV trajectory is optimized by the variable parameter particle swarm annealing (VPPSA) algorithm, and the suboptimal solution of the transmit powers of IoT devices is obtained by the successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of AoI and EC.},

  abstract={The research object of this article is a route correction system of an unmanned aerial vehicle. In order to correct the flight path of the UAV under study, an airborne radar system is used. In the case of active jamming, the radar image cannot be used for route correction. Therefore, the onboard navigation system with algorithm correction is proposed. The error compensation scheme of navigation system is used in the output signal, and the prediction model of system error is constructed by the algorithm. The predictive model is constructed using the genetic algorithm and group method of data handling. The quality of algorithms for constructing predictive model is compared by mathematical model. Algorithmic support that functions with the radar system and in conditions of active interference (these signals are unavailable) for the UAV navigation system has been formed. Correction algorithms for autonomous UAV navigation systems including genetic algorithms and prediction algorithms have been developed. The simulation results prove the performance and efficiency of the developed correction algorithm, which shows that the accuracy of navigation system can be improved and the UAV problems can be solved by using this algorithm.},

Jamming can prevent timely delivery of sensing data and reception of operation instructions. With the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), we propose to augment the radio environment, suppress jamming signals, and enhance the desired signals. The UAV is designed to learn its trajectory and the RIS configuration based solely on changes in its received data rate, using the latest deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed DDPG (TD3) models. Simulations show that the proposed DRL algorithms give the UAV with strong resistance against jamming and that the TD3 algorithm exhibits faster and smoother convergence than the DDPG algorithm, and suits better for larger RISs. This DRL-based approach eliminates the need for knowledge of the channels involving the RIS and jammer, thereby offering significant practical value.},

A reliable and resilient navigation system is essential to the safe operation of UAM applications. The take-off and landing at vertiports is arguably the most challenging phase of operation for the navigation system due to the stringent performance requirements and the complex environment in urban areas. Cameras can be applied as an alternative navigation sensor to GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) and other radiobased navigation systems at vertiports due to its resilience against radio interference and high accuracy at low altitudes. However, the integrity quantification and monitoring of camera-based navigation remains a challenging topic, blocking visual navigation methods from being certified for safety critical applications. In this work, an integrity framework is proposed for applying camera-based positioning during take-off and landing operations at vertiports.},

  abstract={During the last few years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have increasingly become primary components of various critical civilian and military applications.

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant popularity in both military and civilian sectors due to their maneuverability and versatility. However, their reliance on global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) for real-time and precise navigation makes them vulnerable to interference, particularly in hostile jamming environments. In this article, we present a novel approach to address the challenges posed by GNSS jamming in UAVs navigation. Unlike traditional multisensor fusion techniques, our method focuses on physically combining signals from multiple homogeneous sensors, extending centralized multiantenna anti-jamming techniques to cooperative distributed scenarios. This approach leverages frequency conversion and forwarding to bypass GNSS navigation band, enabling signal aggregation. Using multiple UAVs, it enhances system resilience and spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs), achieving both anti-jamming and collaborative navigation objectives simultaneously. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the feasibility and potential of this technique in ensuring precise and secure UAV operations in GNSS-jamming environments.},

Combined with generative navigation spoofing technology to achieve navigation link deception, the interference parameters are optimized by introducing the third-generation genetic algorithm to improve the success rate of interference. Based on the software radio, the UAV is tested for jamming, and the experiment shows that: comb jamming and frequency sweeping jamming can cut off the control link, and the navigation deception makes the UAV deviate from the preset path, which realizes the effective jamming of the UAV.},

  abstract={This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided jamming technique for enabling physical layer keyless security in scenarios where the exact eavesdropper location is unknown. We assume that the unknown eavesdropper location is within an ellipse characterizing the coverage region of the transmitter. By sequentially optimizing the transmit power, the flight path of the UAV and its jamming power, we aim at maximizing the average secrecy rate with arbitrary eavesdropper location. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal flight path obtains better secrecy rate performance compared to that using direct UAV flight path encasing the transmitter and the legitimate receiver. Most importantly, even with the unknown eavesdropper location, we obtained a secrecy rate that is comparable to a scenario when the eavesdropper's location is known. However, the average secrecy rate with the unknown eavesdropper location varies depending on the proximity of the eavesdropper to the known location of the transmitter. We also observe that due to the UAV-aided jamming, the average secrecy rate stabilizes at some point even though the average received envelope power of the eavesdropper increases. This essentially demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract={To integrate physical layer security and information freshness, this work first proposes the concepts of secure age of information (SAoI) and secure peak AoI (PAoI). Then, four optimizing policies are proposed as well as the suboptimal framework and solutions. The first is the secure PAoI (SPAoI) threshold-constrained Min-PAoI policy, which minimizes the average PAol at the legitimate destination by assuming the SPAol is greater than a threshold. The second is the Max-SPAoI policy which maximizes the average SPAoI. The third is the Max-SPAoI-EC ratio policy which maximizes the ratio of SPAoI to UAV energy consumption (EC). The final one is the SPAoI threshold-constrained Min-WS-PAoI-EC policy, which minimizes the weighted sum of PAoI and UAV EC. The last two policies are energy-efficient. The simulations show that the Min-PAoI policy has the largest range of UAV flights. Both Min-PAoI and Min-WS-PAoI-EC policies have smaller SPAoI, but the two policies achieve the fresher status update. The Min-WS-PAoI-EC policy is more promising because of the low PAoI, security guarantee, and high energy efficiency.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could acquire strong line-of-sight (LoS) channels for terrestrial nodes, which means UAV communications are more vulnerable to jammers and eavesdroppers. Thanks to the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), it is capable of reconfiguring the propagation environment and has good prospects for forthcoming secure transmission in combination with UAV wireless network. In this paper, we facilitate RIS to aid the uplink communication between the ground user and the UAV in the existence of a malevolent jammer and an eavesdropper by maximizing the average secrecy rate (ASR) of the proposed scheme. In order to achieve this goal, we jointly optimize the transmission power of the ground user, the RIS phase shift, and the trajectory of the UAV. Nevertheless, the proposed problem cannot be solved directly because of the coupled optimization variables and the non-convexity. Consequently, we tackle it by decomposing the original problem into three achievable sub-problems, in which formulated problem could be handled by using alternative optimization, the successive convex approximation, and semidefinite relaxation. Finally, we continuously optimize three variables and iterate over three sub-problems until the ASR converges to a stationary value. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme effectively boost the ASR compared with other baselines.},

  year={2019},

  pages={7815-7827},
  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in various fields, which mainly relies on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) to obtain position information. However, fast-moving jamming poses a big challenge for UAV navigation. This motivates us to develop new robust adaptive beamforming technique that is capable of enhancing the navigation signal and suppressing the jamming efficiently. Since the navigation signal and jamming present non-Gaussianity in statistics, the minimum dispersion distortionless response (MDDR) beamformer is utilized, which exhibits better performance of non-Gaussian signal reception over the minimum variance-based beamformer. To suppress the fast-moving jamming, the minimum power constraint is added to the optimization problem regarding to the MDDR beamformer, leading to a resultant problem with a quadratic constraint. Furthermore, instead of the quadratic constraint, a linear version is derived under the power constraint to achieve a shape null sector towards the fast-moving jamming, and as a consequence, a linearly constrained MDDR beamforming is established. This allows us to develop two algorithms, i.e., quasi-MVDR algorithm and Newton's method, to accelerate the solution. Simulation results show that the proposed beamformer is able to suppress the fast-moving jamming efficiently for UAV navigation.},

  abstract={Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are a key source of position, navigation, and timing for Unmanned Aircraft Systems. This holds true for the new e-ID technology as well, which is compulsory for drones operating in the SPECIFIC category since 2024. Both portable and embedded e-ID devices are a new addition to the market as a reaction to the new legislation. However, these electronic visibility enablers may be susceptible to GNSS interference, possibly leading to denial of service or false position and time information being reported. To assess the vulnerability of these newly introduced e-ID devices, two of them were subjected to a series of GNSS interference attacks. The testing included jamming-only attacks, spoofing-only attacks and attacks combining jamming with subsequent spoofing. The results show the impact of all these attacks on the position and time information, the number of satellites in view and other parameters. Additionally, the results highlight the differences between a GNSS-only e-ID device and an e-ID device with both GNSS and inertia sensors. Finally, the potential of using accuracy indicators in e-ID messages for GNSS interference detection is discussed.},

  abstract={This paper investigates a multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enabled cooperative secure transmission scheme in the presence of multiple potential eavesdroppers. Specifically, multiple source UAVs (SUAVs) send confidential information to multiple legitimate ground users, and in the meantime, multiple jamming UAVs cooperatively transmit interference signals to multiple eavesdroppers in order to improve the legitimate users' achievable secrecy rate. By taking into account the limited energy budget of UAV, our goal is to maximize the system secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), namely the achievable secrecy rate per energy consumption unit, by jointly optimizing the UAV trajectory, transmit power, and user scheduling under the constraints of UAV mobility as well as the maximum transmit power. The resulting optimization problem is shown to be a non-convex and mixed-integer fractional optimization problem, which is challenging to solve. We decompose the original problem into three sub-problems, and then, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed by leveraging the block coordinate descent method and Dinkelbach method in combination with successive convex approximation techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the other benchmarks significantly in terms of the system SEE.},

  abstract={With the maneuverability and mobility control of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), carrying mobile edge computing (MEC) servers on UAVs is able to effectively alleviate the explosive growth of data traffic pressure. However, UAV adopts line-of-sight transmission which has broadcasting characteristics. Malicious eavesdroppers can easily take advantage of the characteristics to eavesdrop information during the UAV edge computing. Therefore, the security of the UAV-MEC systems is a challenging problem. This article proposes a secure communication scheme for the dual-UAV-MEC system. In the proposed scheme, UAV server assists ground users in calculating the offloading tasks. In order to reduce the eavesdropping of offloading information by UAV eavesdropper, jammer sends interference signals on the ground. We aim to maximize the user's minimum secure calculation capacity by optimizing resources and trajectory of the UAV server. We first transform the optimization problem into a tractable form through mathematical methods and use successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent algorithms to solve it in an iterative manner. The final numerical results show that, compared with the benchmark schemes, the method proposed in this article effectively increases the secure calculation capacity of the system.},

This proposed system will consist of a detection system with Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) used for drone detection by measuring position, direction, and speed to identify incoming objects. The second process is Radio Frequency classification (RF-classification) using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the control signal emitted by both the drone and its operator to classify the type of received signal in the ISM band widely used in commercial drones. The last process is Jamming the ISM band control signal using a highly transmitted power jamming signal to prevent a drone from being recognized and controlled by its operator and spoofing the Global Positioning System (GPS) in the L1 band commonly used in a non-military application for drone neutralization. In the future, the proposed system design will be tested in various possible environments and situations so that the test results can be used for further improvements and corrections.},

  abstract={Fourth-generation (4G) mobile networks are successively replaced by fifth-generation (5G) ones, based on the new releases of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standard. 5G generation is dedicated to civilian users and the conducted analytical work shows that it has numerous technological gaps that prevent its direct implementation in military communications systems. However, the recent armed world conflicts showed that closed or public mobile networks are willingly used by soldiers for both private and business communications, and to conduct defensive and offensive operations as well. From the military operation viewpoint, jamming both civil and military systems is one of the essential elements of electronic warfare. This paper focuses on the practical trial of low-energy and smart jamming on a 5G private network using narrowband signals, which facilitates the reduction of the available throughput, e.g. in the time division duplex - uplink (TDD-UL) by 99%, or by 82% in the frequency division duplex - downlink (FDD-DL). This type of jamming also allows for reaching up to 25 dB of energy gain comparing to barrage jamming. The authors moreover investigated jamming the Narrowband IoT radio interface using synchronized, selective jamming. The goal was to propose energy efficient methods that will allow the jammers to work longer and be mounted on a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that can operate near the gNB. The generation of low-power jamming signals in the gNB vicinity successfully hinders detecting the jammer by the enemy’s electronic reconnaissance systems. The proposed solutions are compared with the test results for other types of jamming methods.},

  abstract={The rapid advancement of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology has led to its increasingly widespread application in both military and civilian sectors. However, the security risks posed by non-cooperative drones have become increasingly prominent. Traditional interception methods, such as net capture and high-power signal suppression, are limited by factors including short effective range and high costs. This paper proposes a lightweight navigation jamming and spoofing system. By designing a highly integrated navigation receiver antenna, transmitting antenna, and jamming source host, the system supports flexible switching between three operational modes. This capability enables effective management and control of non-cooperative drones. Experimental results demonstrate that the system successfully achieves both static jamming and dynamic spoofing of target drones, significantly enhancing the precision and reliability of UAV countermeasures. The development of this system offers a novel approach for low-cost, high-efficiency drone countermeasures, showcasing significant potential for application.},

Our goal is to maximize the average (expected) secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the source transmit power, UAV jamming power and trajectory for a given flight time. Since the expected secrecy rate is highly complicated with respect to the UAV trajectory, we derive a more tractable lower bound for it.

  abstract={The paper is devoted to research on unmanned aerial vehicle navigation using spatial-spectral portraits of the terrain. Such navigation is relevant in the event of failure of global positioning system receivers and other navigation equipment, but its implementation requires the solution of a number of methodological issues. In particular, the effect of illumination changes on the spectral characteristics of objects should be taken into account. The borrowing of satellite solutions using optical patterns is inadequate for low-flying unmanned aerial vehicles and it is more promising to use the service data from the meter display of the spectral sensory equipment of the unmanned aerial vehicle. In this research, an existing method for correction of illumination changes based on the value of LightValue for different cameras in laboratory and field conditions is considered. It has been experimentally established that the dependencies between LightValue and the intensities of color constituents in different cameras are individual in nature. For the correction due to changes in natural light, it is suggested to use experimentally obtained dependences for specific brands of the sensory equipment. When organizing navigation systems for spectral portraits of the terrain, it is recommended to use objects with the most stable optical changes in terms of illumination.},

  abstract={This paper investigates a dual-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided communication system to improve the security of the communication between ground devices and UAVs. Different from the existing works which ignored ground devices mobility and just considered one-way communication security between ground devices and UAVs, we allow the devices to be mobile and consider bi-directional ground-UAV communication security. Specifically, one UAV server communicates with mobile ground devices, and the other UAV jammer is invoked to confuse eavesdroppers. Our objective is to maximize the worst-case average secrecy rate by the joint optimization of UAV trajectory and sender transmit power. To achieve it, we first formulate the worst-case average secrecy rate maximization problem as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) under the constraints of UAV flight space, flight speed, energy capacity, anti-collision, and peak transmit power. Then, we design a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) based algorithm to solve the CMDP. Experiment results demonstrate that our joint optimization scheme can enhance the communication security in terms of the secrecy rate in both UAV-to-ground (U2G) case and ground-to-UAV (G2U) case. Besides, it is observed that UAV trajectory and sender transmit power have different impacts on the communication security in U2G case and G2U case.},

  abstract={The rapid increase in the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAV) across various critical sectors, such as defense, underscores the urgent need to address their vulnerability to GPS-based interference. This project examines the dual threats of GPS spoofing and jamming, both of which can significantly undermine the integrity and reliability of drone operations. Spoofing misleads the flight controller by manipulating location data causing the drone to believe it is operating in a different location than its actual position, while Jamming disrupts communication with satellite signals, making navigation systems ineffective. Utilizing a Cube Orange with Pixhawk, HackRF One, Here3+ GPS, and a custom- built VCO-based RF jammer, this study examines the serious implications of these threats on drone stability and functionality. The project follows a systematic approach, starting with the careful assembly and calibration of a custom quadcopter. By employing gps-sdr-sim software and HackRF One, realistic spoofing signals were created to manipulate GPS telemetry, while a custom-designed jammer circuit, developed in Altium Designer, showcased the ability to disable navigation systems completely. Testing and validation were carried out using Mission Planner and QGroundControl, revealing that spoofing could convincingly change the drone’s perceived location, resulting in incorrect behavior, while jamming led to immediate operational failure.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology have been employed in the field of communication. In this paper, we propose an ISAC-UAV assisted secure communication system amidst multiple eavesdroppers. In each time slot, we implement ISAC and communication functions. Since there are multiple eavesdroppers in the system, jammer UAV is required to send jamming signals to the eavesdroppers. During the ISAC process, the source UAV identifies multiple eavesdroppers, relaying their position information to a jammer UAV. During the communication process, multiple eavesdroppers attempt to intercept the communication link between source UAV and users. We use the center of all users as the horizontal location of the jammer UAV. To maximize the secure data transmit rate, we propose a joint optimization problem involving user scheduling, transmit power, and source UAV trajectory. We break down the non-convex optimization problem into three subproblems, and then achieve the suboptimal solution to the original problem through iteratively optimizing these subproblems. Simulation results indicate that the proposed solution can achieve significant secure transmit rate even in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm systems have been extensively deployed in both civilian and military applications. As the command center of the swarm, the control station plays a crucial role in determining mission completion capabilities. This paper proposes enhanced dual control station protocol that employs hot standby stations operating in mutual standby mode. When anomalies occur in the primary control station, seamless switching to the standby one is immediately initiated, thereby ensuring uninterrupted working of the UAV swarm system. Furthermore, the standby control station possesses an additional function of data forwarding for error correction. When wireless communication is compromised by interference, the standby control station can forward critical commands to UAVs, thereby enhancing anti-jamming capabilities.},

  abstract={The combination of Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mobile edge computing (MEC) can efficiently alleviate the computing burden caused by enormous data flow in the context of 6G, especially for the latency-sensitive and computation-intensive tasks in some remote scenarios without available infrastructure. However, the security of information transmitted from ground to air through line-of-sight (LoS) wireless channels remains a major concern due to their broadcast nature. To address this issue, this work studies a secure UAV-assisted MEC system, where a UAV functions as a MEC node to provide computation service for the ground users, while the other UAV functions as a jammer to inject signals to the ground eavesdropper (EV) with an imperfectly known position. The overall energy consumption, encompassing computation, communication, and UAV flight, is minimized under resource limitations. This is achieved through the joint optimization of user transmit power, task allocation for computation, and trajectories for UAVs. Due to the non-convex of the formulated problem, which pertains to the interdependence of various variables in a nonlinear manner, we propose a double-layered robust task allocation and trajectory optimization (RTATO) algorithm. In the first layer, we optimize task and power allocation using the Taylor expansion method. In the second layer, UAV trajectory scheduling is optimized using the slack variable method and successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Simulation results indicate that the algorithm we suggest significantly improves energy consumption in terms of robustness and security compared to benchmark schemes.},

  abstract={The secure performance of wideband cognitive radio networks (CRNs) with OFDMA (orthogonal frequency-division multiple access) achieved by using physical layer security is low due to the severe channel fading and the limit transmit power of the secondary base station (SBS). To improve the secure performance, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted jamming wideband CRNs is studied where a UAV transmits the jamming signal to interfere with the eavesdropper (Eve) and the SBS provides communication services for the secondary users (SUs) over multiple sub-carrier channels. The total average secrecy rate of the secondary network is maximized by jointly optimizing the sub-carrier allocation, the jamming UAV trajectory, and the transmission power of the UAV and the SBS. An alternative algorithm is proposed to solve the challenging non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results verify the efficiency of our proposed algorithm and show that UAV-assisted jamming is beneficial for improving secure performance of wideband CRNs. It is also shown that our proposed scheme outperforms the benchmark schemes in terms of the total average secrecy rate.},

  abstract={This paper exploits the mobility of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to improve the physical layer (PLS) security against potential eavesdropping scenarios, where the sensitive data transmitted from a ground base station (GBS) to multiple information receivers (IRs) is easily eavesdropped by multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers (Eves). Specifically, the UAV is employed as a friendly jammer to transmit artificial noise to degrade the wiretap channels. By leveraging the UAV's mobility and the possibility of establishing line-of-sight links, the UAV can move close to the Eves and opportunistically jam them. Especially, two practical factors, namely, the imperfect location information of Eves and the existence of no-fly zones are considered. Since only the partial position information of the Eves can be known, as the worst case, the minimum average secrecy rate of IRs is robustly optimized by jointly designing the trajectory and jamming power of the UAV, and the transmission power of the GBS to ensure the security of all IRs. However, the formulated problem with coupled variables is non-convex and intractable. As such, an efficient alternative iterative suboptimal algorithm is proposed to solve this problem by applying the block coordinate descent, successive convex approximation, slack variables, and $\mathcal {S}$-Procedure. Numerical results reveal that the proposed robust algorithm can substantially improve the max-min average secrecy rate, and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is further verified by comparing it with three benchmark schemes.},

  abstract={Precise navigation signals are essential for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to achieve accurate positioning and task execution. However, global positioning system (GPS) signals are highly vulnerable to spoofing and jamming attacks, posing serious threats to flight safety. Therefore, this article proposes an intelligent detection algorithm based on federated learning (FL) for identifying spoofing and jamming signals in UAV navigation. First, the algorithm innovatively integrates the local feature extraction ability of the temporal convolutional network (TCN) and the global dependency modeling advantage of the Transformer network, constructing a TCN-Transformer model to capture the features of navigation data efficiently. Second, a distributed construction network is adopted, where weight aggregation and updates are performed via FL, enabling global optimization without data sharing. Furthermore, an accuracy-weighted aggregation strategy is introduced, dynamically assigning weights based on the detection performance of each client mode. This encourages contributions of high-quality data and computational resources, thereby enhancing the overall model performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional algorithms in detecting navigation spoofing and jamming, offering superior detection accuracy and robustness.},

Thus, this paper proposes a secure transmission approach assisted by deploying a cooperative UAV to transmit artificial noise to jam an active eavesdropper, in order to maximize the system secrecy rate under the quality of service (QoS) requirement of a primary device. Specifically, we jointly optimize the flight trajectory and transmission power of the cooperative jammer to maximize the system's secrecy rate under strict constraints. To achieve this, we convert the non-convex problem into an approximately convex problem using the block coordinate descent algorithm and successive convex approximation method.

We first formulate the problem as a sequential decision making problem in discrete domain, with connectivity, collision avoidance, and kinematic constraints. We, then, propose an offline temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm with online signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) mapping to solve the problem. More specifically, a value network is constructed and trained offline by TD method to encode the interactions among the UAVs and between the UAVs and the environment; and an online SINR mapping deep neural network (DNN) is designed and trained by supervised learning, to encode the influence and changes due to the jammer. Numerical results show that, without any information on the jammer, the proposed algorithm can achieve performance levels close to that of the ideal scenario with the perfect SINR-map. Real-time navigation for multi-UAVs can be efficiently performed with high success rates, and collisions are avoided.},

  abstract={This paper considers secure communications for an underlay cognitive radio network (CRN) in the presence of an external eavesdropper (Eve). The secrecy performance of CRNs is usually limited by the primary receiver's interference power constraint. To overcome this issue, we propose to use an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a friendly jammer to interfere Eve in decoding the confidential message from the secondary transmitter. Our goal is to jointly optimize the transmit power and UAV's trajectory in the three-dimensional space to maximize the average achievable secrecy rate of the secondary system. The formulated optimization problem is nonconvex due to the non-convexity of the objective and non-convexity of constraints, which is very challenging to solve. To obtain a suboptimal but efficient solution to the design problem, we first transform it into a more tractable form and then develop an iterative algorithm for its solution by leveraging the inner approximation (IA) framework. Combining tools from IA framework and S-procedure, we further extend the proposed algorithm to a more realistic scenario, where the imperfect location information of ground nodes (including Eve, secondary receiver and primary receiver) is considered, resulting in the average worst-case secrecy rate. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the merits of the proposed algorithms over existing approaches.},

Under the assumption that the location formation of the Eves is imperfect, we jointly optimize the robust trajectory and transmit power of the UAV over a finite flight period to maximize the SR's average worst-case secrecy rate, while controlling the co-channel interference imposed on the primary receivers (PRs) below a tolerable level. The design is formulated as a non-convex semi-infinite optimization problem that is challenging to be optimally solved. To deal with it, we first prove that the considered problem can be simplified as a more tractable one, which resolves the location uncertainties of the Eves without the aid of $\mathcal S$ -Procedure adopted in conventional methods. After that, an efficient iterative algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) is developed to obtain a locally optimal solution.

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) have become a hotspot in recent years. However, due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, it is difficult to avoid the presence of eavesdroppering in the networks, which can severely influence the users privacy protection between users and UAVs. In order to enhance the communication security of the networks while reducing system latency, this paper considers a dual UAV-assisted edge computing system that contains two UAVs: one UAV acts as an MEC server to process users' offloaded computation tasks, and the other multi-role UAV can function as a jammer or a relay, which depends on the users' expectations, to improve communication security and reduce system latency. However, due to the variables coupling and inconsistency in user preferences for UAV functionalities, the jointly optimization of UAV trajectories, computation resource allocation, and multi-role UAV's functionality switching is challenging. To address this issue, this paper proposes Distributed UAV Functionality Switching and Trajectory Design (DUFST) algorithm, which utilizes block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) to decouple the variables. Then, DUFST adopts the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to tackle the problem of inconsistent user preferences for UAV functionality selection. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of this algorithm, which outperforms other comparative algorithms in terms of performance.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play a critical role for 5 G/B5G communications. In this paper, we investigate the physical layer security issue for ground transmissions with the help of a UAV. Specifically, we consider the scenario without direct transmissions and employ the UAV as a mobile relay to amplify and forward the confidential information. Meanwhile, the receiver transmits cooperative jamming attempting to disrupt eavesdropping. We investigate the UAV deployment and receiver jamming strategy jointly for the optimized secrecy rate, while considering the channel uncertainties. In particular, for the case of complete channel state information (CSI), the jamming power is obtained by bi-section search, and we propose a data-trained deep neural network (DNN) to approximate the optimal UAV deployment. Meanwhile, for the case with partial CSI, we design a deep Q network (DQN) to learn the optimal UAV deployment, due to the increased complexity to determine the jamming strategy with channel statistics. Simulation results demonstrate that both the learned DQN and trained DNN model effectively approximate the optimal deployment of the UAV. Moreover, compared with the baselines, our proposal significantly improves the security performance of legitimate transmissions.},

  abstract={Drones play a crucial role in civil engineering tasks such as logistics and data collection. While existing autonomous drone research focuses on safe path planning in static environments, urban navigation remains a challenge due to dynamic factors like wind disturbances, complex building layouts, and signal interference. Traditional autonomous navigation methods struggle in urban settings, where wind variations, GPS limitations, and unpredictable obstacles affect flight stability. Most existing approaches rely on extensive external data sources, increasing computational complexity. Therefore, an efficient, sensor-based solution is required to enable drones to navigate dynamic wind zones with real-time adaptability and high precision. This study introduces a Residual Group Adaptive Dual-Channel Pulse-Coupled Neural Network with Cat Hunting Optimization (RGADCPCNNet-CHO), which leverages local RGB camera and GPS data to enhance drone navigation without relying on external inputs. The framework integrates Window-Aware Guided Image Filtering (WGBF) to refine GPS-estimated wind force with RGB camera data, while a Cswin Transformer extracts features such as obstacles, wind drift, velocity, and position. The RGADCPCNNet handles path planning, and Cat Hunting Optimization (CHO) optimizes hyperparameters for better adaptability. The proposed model achieves 99.15% accuracy, 99.14% recalls, 0.99 explained variance ratio (EVA), and a low RMSE of 0.41, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods.},

  abstract={This paper considers a novel scenario, where a physical layer security issue is studied in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted cognitive relay system. A secondary unmanned aerial vehicle (SUAV) relay delivers information from multiple secondary Internet of things (IoT) devices to a secondary user (SU) under the spectrum sharing with primary users (PUs). In the processing of the information transmission of the SUAV relay, a secondary eavesdropper (SE) wiretaps the information transmitted by the UAV relay with imperfect location information. In order to confuse the SE, a friendly SUAV jammer is employed to transmit jamming signals to the SE. To prevent the SE wiretapping information as much as possible, we aim to maximize average worst-case secrecy rate of the secondary relay network by jointly optimizing robust trajectories and power of the SUAV relay and jammer under the power, trajectories, information causality and multiple interference temperature (IT) threshold constraints. Thus, we formulate the original problem which is a challenging non-convex problem. We propose an effective algorithm to solve the original problem and attain locally optimal solution based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) technology and the alternate optimization method. Simulations are offered to demonstrate that our proposed resource allocation scheme can effectively improve the security performance of the SUAV relay network in comparison with other benchmark schemes.},

The effect of multipath signal interference on the elevation angle estimate is handled by a constant offset calibration. In field experiments, we demonstrate approach path following using a Skywalker X8 fixed-wing UAV and a Bluetooth antenna array. For 39 approach repetitions the resulting impact positions 40m in front of the array had standard deviations of 0.41m horizontally and 0.32m vertically according to precise RTK GNSS positioning used for comparison.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is of crucial importance in realizing heterogeneous practical wireless application scenarios. However, it is susceptible to the severe spectrum scarcity and interference issues since it operates in the unlicensed frequency band. To tackle those issues, a dynamic spectrum sharing UAV network adopting an anti-jamming technique is considered. Two intelligent spectrum allocation and trajectory optimization schemes are designed, capitalizing on the proposed external interaction and internal inference based frameworks. For the first scheme, a novel external interaction based hybrid online-offline multi-agent actor-critic and deep deterministic policy gradient (MA2C-DDPG) framework is proposed taking into account the hybrid characteristics of discrete spectrum allocation and continuous UAV trajectory. As for the second scheme, another novel framework, the deep active inference (DAI) based on internal inference is proposed, which minimizes the internal variational free energy. Moreover, a belief learning based method is exploited to enhance the agents’ perception and improve the action selection in the dynamic spectrum sharing environment. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the high efficiency of our proposed schemes. It is shown that our proposed schemes significantly improve the secondary network sum transmission rate compared to various benchmark schemes. Moreover, the proposed MA2C-DDPG and DAI frameworks demonstrate the advantages in improving the training stability and convergence speed.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the use of artificial noise assistance to achieve covert communication between unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and ground users in the presence of illegal detector on the ground. Specifically, there is a UAV in the air that serves as a transmitting user and communicates with ground receiving user. In order to achieve covert information transmission, a friendly jammer is deployed on the ground to emit artificial noise and interfere with the detection of ground detector, thereby assisting in covert information transmission between the UAV and ground user. We aim to maximize the covert transmission rate through the joint optimization of UAV flight trajectory and transmit power. The optimization problem is a non-convex optimization problem and difficult to solve directly. We introduce relaxation variables to equivalently transform it into a more manageable problem, and design an alternating iterative optimization algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) technology to solve this optimization problem. The simulation results indicate that the joint optimization strategy and algorithm can effectively improve the covert transmission rate between UAV and ground user.},

  abstract={Due to the broadcast feature of the wireless channels, users are easily eavesdropped by eavesdroppers during data transmission, resulting in data leakage. To ensure the Device-to-device (D2D) communications security, in this paper, we propose a UAV-assisted secure communication system where a mobile UAV can transmit the jamming signal to counter the ground eavesdropper to enhance the security of communication. We develop a connection outage probability model to ensure the continuous communication and derive the closed form expression of the connection outage probability for D2D users. We formulated a secrecy rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing UAV’s trajectory and jamming power, in which, the secrecy rate is defined as the difference between the transmission rate and the eavesdropping rate. To solve it, we propose a TD3-based algorithm to optimize the UAV’s trajectory and jamming power. Simulation results illustrate that the overall average secrecy rate of D2D users achieved by our proposed algorithm outperforms other baselines.},

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained a lot of attention due to their applications in various sectors. Most of fully autonomous UAVs navigation system is dependent on GNSS for localization. But the security threats that emanates from GPS system; spoofing and jamming makes the reliance on GNSS problematic. In this work, we proposed a fully autonomous UAV navigation system without GNSS and wireless communication. The application area of interest in this work is military battlefield. The proposed navigation method combines information gathered by Intelligence Preparation for Battlefield (IPB) and Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance(ISR) group and onboard sensors.

The integrated way of navigation used to assess the conceptual possibility of autonomous navigation without the use of external navigation system and reliable operation of UAV at GPS and wireless signal denied environment. In addition, to ensure reliable operation of the navigation system, devices health monitoring system through the use of distributed monitoring agent and AI algorithms are proposed.

  abstract={With the increasing prevalence of small drones, the associated security risks are becoming increasingly prominent. Mainstream countermeasures include radio suppression jamming, navigation deception, fire damage, and directed energy attacks. Among these, navigation deception technology offers strong versatility, flexibility, and low radiation power by causing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to deviate from preset flight routes through false satellite signals. To enhance the accuracy of UAV trajectory spoofing, this study proposes a method to identify the guidance model of rotary-wing UAVs by analyzing flight control mechanisms and constructing navigation and guidance models under spoofing conditions. A guidance model identification algorithm was designed for two common guidance modes in rotary-wing UAVs: classical and L1 guidance. The method was applied to a PX4-based simulation platform, where the guidance model of a quadrotor UAV was successfully recognized, effectively verifying the feasibility of the proposed algorithm.},
