Abstract = {This paper investigates the anti-jamming trajectory design to safeguard
   the effective data collection, where a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is
   dispatched to collect data over multiple sensor nodes(SNs) in jamming
   environment. Under the limited power and transmission range of SNs, we
   aim to minimize the UAV's flight energy consumption in a finite task
   period, by jointly optimizing SNs collection sequence and UAV flight
   trajectory. Firstly, we propose a general optimization framework which
   consists of path planning and trajectory optimization for the formulated
   non-convex problem. In the path planning phase, a dynamic programming
   (DP) algorithm is used to provide the initial path of the UAV, which is
   the shortest path to visit each SN. In the trajectory optimization
   phase, we introduce the concept of Communication Flight Corridor (CFC)
   to meet the non-convex constraints and apply a piecewise Bezier curve,
   based on Bernoulli polynomial, to represent the flight trajectory of the
   UAV, which can transform the optimization variables from infinite time
   variables to polynomial coefficients of finite order. Finally, we
   simulate the flight trajectory of UAV in hovering mode and continuous
   flight mode under different parameters, and the simulation results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {With the maneuverability and mobility control of unmanned aerial vehicle
   (UAV), carrying mobile edge computing (MEC) servers on UAVs is able to
   effectively alleviate the explosive growth of data traffic pressure.
   However, UAV adopts line-of-sight transmission which has broadcasting
   characteristics. Malicious eavesdroppers can easily take advantage of
   the characteristics to eavesdrop information during the UAV edge
   computing. Therefore, the security of the UAV-MEC systems is a
   challenging problem. This article proposes a secure communication scheme
   for the dual-UAV-MEC system. In the proposed scheme, UAV server assists
   ground users in calculating the offloading tasks. In order to reduce the
   eavesdropping of offloading information by UAV eavesdropper, jammer
   sends interference signals on the ground. We aim to maximize the user's
   minimum secure calculation capacity by optimizing resources and
   trajectory of the UAV server. We first transform the optimization
   problem into a tractable form through mathematical methods and use
   successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent algorithms
   to solve it in an iterative manner. The final numerical results show
   that, compared with the benchmark schemes, the method proposed in this
   article effectively increases the secure calculation capacity of the

Abstract = {With the evolutional development of maritime networks, the explosive
   growth of maritime data has put forward elevated demands for the
   computing capabilities of maritime devices (MDs). Unmanned aerial
   vehicle (UAV) is able to alleviate the computing pressure of MDs by
   forwarding the computing tasks to the edge server on the coast. However,
   UAV relaying introduces a significant security challenge due to the
   vulnerability of line-of-sight (LoS) communication channels, which can
   be exploited for eavesdropping on computing tasks. In this paper, an
   efficient secure communication scheme is proposed for UAV-relay-assisted
   maritime mobile edge computing (MEC) with a flying eavesdropper. The
   secure computing capacity of MDs is maximized by jointly optimizing the
   transmit power, time slot allocation factor, computation optimization
   and UAV trajectory. Due to multi-variable coupling, the formulated
   optimization problem (OP) is non-convex. We first transform OP by
   introducing auxiliary variables. Then, the transformed OP is decomposed
   and solved in an iterative manner by applying block coordinate descent
   (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Numerical results show
   that the secure computing capability of the UAV-relay-assisted maritime
   MEC system of proposed secure communication scheme can be effectively

Abstract = {With the advantages of high mobility and flexible deployment, Unmanned
   Aerial Vehicle (UAV) combines with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a
   promising technology. When dynamic Terminal Users (TUs) offload tasks to
   UAVs, eavesdroppers may eavesdrop on the channel information. The
   offloading decisions, trajectory plannings of UAVs and resource
   allocation with the objective of high-capacity secure communication is a
   challenging problem. In this paper, we design a multi-UAVs MEC system,
   where the original region is divided into several sub-regions and TUs
   offload tasks to UAVs which provide computing services for these TUs.
   Meanwhile, A joint optimization problem of offloading decision, resource
   allocation and trajectory planning is formulated, where TUs move with
   the Gauss-Markov random model. In addition, the Base Station (BS) emits
   jamming signals to evade the eavesdropping of offloading information
   from eavesdroppers. The goal of the optimization problem is to maximize
   the TUs' minimum secure calculation capacity, and a Joint Dynamic
   Programming and Bidding (JDPB) algorithm is proposed to solve it. The
   Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) and Block Coordinate Descent (BCD)
   algorithms are used to handle the resource allocation and trajectory

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is of crucial importance in
   realizing heterogeneous practical wireless application scenarios.
   However, it is susceptible to the severe spectrum scarcity and
   interference issues since it operates in the unlicensed frequency band.
   To tackle those issues, a dynamic spectrum sharing UAV network adopting
   an anti-jamming technique is considered. Two intelligent spectrum
   allocation and trajectory optimization schemes are designed,
   capitalizing on the proposed external interaction and internal inference
   based frameworks. For the first scheme, a novel external interaction
   based hybrid online-offline multi-agent actor-critic and deep
   deterministic policy gradient (MA2C-DDPG) framework is proposed taking
   into account the hybrid characteristics of discrete spectrum allocation
   and continuous UAV trajectory. As for the second scheme, another novel
   framework, the deep active inference (DAI) based on internal inference
   is proposed, which minimizes the internal variational free energy.
   Moreover, a belief learning based method is exploited to enhance the
   agents' perception and improve the action selection in the dynamic
   spectrum sharing environment. Extensive simulation results demonstrate
   the high efficiency of our proposed schemes. It is shown that our
   proposed schemes significantly improve the secondary network sum
   transmission rate compared to various benchmark schemes. Moreover, the
   proposed MA2C-DDPG and DAI frameworks demonstrate the advantages in

Abstract = {In this article, a mission planning and trajectory optimization scheme
   in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm for track deception against radar
   networks is proposed. The core of this scheme is to formulate the track
   deception problem as a model with the objective of simultaneously
   maximizing the number of phantom tracks while minimizing the total
   flight distance of the UAV swarm, subject to the constraints of UAV
   kinematic performance, phantom track rotation angles, and a homology
   test. It is shown that the formulated track deception problem is a
   mixed-integer programming, multivariable, and non-linear optimization
   model. By incorporating mission planning based on platform reuse and a
   particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, a three-stage solution
   methodology is proposed to tackle the above problem. Through joint
   optimization for mission planning and flight trajectories of the UAV
   swarm, a low-speed UAV swarm is capable of generating a number of
   high-speed phantom tracks. Numerical results demonstrate that the

Abstract = {This article presents a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
   approach to the trajectory planning and jamming rejection of an unmanned
   aerial vehicle (UAV) for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
   Jamming can prevent timely delivery of sensing data and reception of

   intelligent surface (RIS), we propose to augment the radio environment,
   suppress jamming signals, and enhance the desired signals. The UAV is
   designed to learn its trajectory and the RIS configuration based solely
   on changes in its received data rate, using the latest deep
   deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed DDPG (TD3) models.
   Simulations show that the proposed DRL algorithms give the UAV with
   strong resistance against jamming and that the TD3 algorithm exhibits
   faster and smoother convergence than the DDPG algorithm, and suits
   better for larger RISs. This DRL-based approach eliminates the need for
   knowledge of the channels involving the RIS and jammer, thereby offering

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose and analyze the maximal secrecy capability of
   an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based relay non-orthogonal multiple
   access system. In this system, a UAV acts as an aerial relay station to
   assist transmission from a source to two users in the presence of a
   terrestrial eavesdropper and a friendly jamming UAV. The minimum
   achievable secrecy rate (MASR) of two users is derived as a metric
   indicator to quantify the security of the system under the assumption
   that the location of the eavesdropper is imprecise. In order to maximize
   MASR, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize system
   parameters, i.e., the trajectory of UAVs, transmit and jamming powers,
   as well as power allocation factors. Since the objective function and
   constraints of the total problem are non-convex, the successive convex
   approximation and block coordinate descent techniques are applied to
   find efficient approximate solutions. Simulation results demonstrate

Abstract = {This paper considers a mobile jammer-aided unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
   relay communication system, where a relay UAV assists information
   transmission between the source node and the destination node, while a
   friendly jammer UAV emits an interference signal to the eavesdropper to

Journal = {APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {148},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In the military field, the utilization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
   formations to carry out saturation attacks on enemy forces is the
   development trend of future war. Traditional path planning algorithms
   have the disadvantages of poor real-time performance, poor flexibility,
   poor scalability, and weak anti-jamming ability, which make these
   algorithms difficult to apply in the control of large-scale joint
   non-uniform military UAV formations. This paper proposes a pathplanning
   method for large-scale, low-cost military UAVs, it addresses three key
   aspects: system design, path-planning algorithms, and UAV safety
   guarantee. In system design, we implement a distributed formation
   control system. In this setup, individual agents can perform flight
   tasks independently using autonomous algorithms without needing to
   communicate with a central control center. In path planning algorithms,
   we quantify the four interactions of UAVs and combine them with the
   linear separation force strategy to construct a set of behavior-based
   formation coordination control methods through a reasonable interaction
   combination method. By adding guided paths, based on the integration of
   behavior-based formation coordination control methods, this paper
   retains the advantages of global path planning algorithms, such as high
   success rate, and local path planning algorithms, such as real-time
   performance. By designing a distributed formation control system with
   strong robustness and incorporating an escape mechanism, the system
   benefits from both passive and active fault-tolerant control strategies.
   This significantly enhances the overall stability of the system.
   Ablation experiments demonstrate that the components of the formation
   control system proposed in this paper are reasonable. Simulation
   experiments indicate that the distributed large-scale joint non-uniform
   UAV formation real-time path planning method is secure, stable,
   adaptable to various planning environments, and exhibits a fast
   convergence speed for the formation. Additionally, it is scalable,
   flexible, and suitable for application in large-scale clusters, among
   other benefits.},

   balance the trade-off between trajectory optimization and mode
   selection, this paper investigates the joint trajectory optimization and
   mode selection anti-jamming approach. First, an anti-jamming utility
   considering the cost-efficient and end-to-end capacity gains is
   designed. Second, to model the bounded rationality of both the UAV relay
   and the jammer due to the adversarial context, a biased Stackelberg game
   to analyse the competitive system interactions is proposed. Moreover,
   the existence of Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) in the problem is proved.
   Finally, a joint mode selection and trajectory optimization (JMSTO)
   algorithm based on the multi-armed bandit is proposed to obtain the SE.
   It is further demonstrated that the JMSTO algorithm has a logarithmic
   regret. The results show that our proposed JMSTO algorithm is superior
   to non-joint optimization methods.},

Abstract = {Physical layer security is effective to solve the problem of

   eavesdropper with active attack and passive eavesdropping exists in the
   IoT, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ( UAV) transmits artificial noise to the

   estimating eavesdropper position, a trajectory optimization algorithm
   based on Q-learning is proposed to track the eavesdropper mobility and

   proposed algorithm converges quickly. UAV can track the eavesdropper
   mobility to determine the best position of jamming the eavesdropping

Abstract = {In this article, a resilient path planning scheme is proposed to
   navigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to its planned (nominal)
   destination with minimum energy consumption in the presence of a
   strategic attacker. The UAV is equipped with the following two sensors:
   1) a GPS sensor, which is vulnerable to spoofing attacks; 2) a
   wellfunctioning ultrawideband (UWB) sensor, which is possible to be
   deceived. It is shown that a covert attacker can significantly deviate
   the UAV's path without being detected by the UWB sensor by
   simultaneously corrupting the GPS signals and forging control inputs.
   The prerequisite for the attack occurrence is first discussed. Based on
   this prerequisite, an optimal attack scheme is proposed, which maximizes
   the deviation between the nominal destination and the real one.
   Correspondingly, an energy-efficient and resilient navigation scheme
   based on Pontryagin's maximum principle is formulated, which suppresses
   the above covert attacker effectively. Essentially, this problem can be
   seen as a Stackelberg game between a resilient path planner (defender)
   and a covert attacker. The effectiveness of our theoretical results is
   illustrated via two simulation examples.},

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely applied in
   internet-of-things (IoT) scenarios while the security for UAV
   communications remains a challenging problem due to the broadcast nature

   the security problems for dual UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC)
   systems, where one UAV is invoked to help the ground terminal devices
   (TDs) to compute the offloaded tasks and the other one acts as a jammer
   to suppress the vicious eavesdroppers. In our framework, minimum secure
   computing capacity maximization problems are proposed for both the time
   division multiple access (TDMA) scheme and non-orthogonal multiple
   access (NOMA) scheme by jointly optimizing the communication resources,
   computation resources, and UAVs' trajectories. The formulated problems
   are non-trivial and challenging to be solved due to the highly coupled
   variables. To tackle these problems, we first transform them into more

   penalized block coordinate descent based algorithm are proposed to solve
   the problems for TDMA and NOMA schemes, respectively. Finally, numerical

Abstract = {As the general mobile edge computing (MEC) scheme cannot adequately

   unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted vehicular edge computing networks
   (VECNs) are envisioned as the reliable and cost-efficient paradigm for

   propose an optimal UAV flight trajectory algorithm based on the traffic

   the real-time traffic conditions, and assigns UAVs to different mission
   areas periodically. Then, a flight trajectory optimization problem is
   formulated to minimize the cost of UAVs, while both the UAV flying and

Abstract = {This paper considers secure communications for an underlay cognitive
   radio network (CRN) in the presence of an external eavesdropper (Eve).
   The secrecy performance of CRNs is usually limited by the primary
   receiver's interference power constraint. To overcome this issue, we
   propose to use an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a friendly jammer to
   interfere Eve in decoding the confidential message from the secondary
   transmitter. Our goal is to jointly optimize the transmit power and
   UAV's trajectory in the three-dimensional space to maximize the average
   achievable secrecy rate of the secondary system. The formulated
   optimization problem is nonconvex due to the non-convexity of the
   objective and non-convexity of constraints, which is very challenging to
   solve. To obtain a suboptimal but efficient solution to the design
   problem, we first transform it into a more tractable form and then
   develop an iterative algorithm for its solution by leveraging the inner
   approximation (IA) framework. Combining tools from IA framework and
   S-procedure, we further extend the proposed algorithm to a more
   realistic scenario, where the imperfect location information of ground
   nodes (including Eve, secondary receiver and primary receiver) is
   considered, resulting in the average worst-case secrecy rate. Extensive

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication is a significant
   technology in 6G communication. In order to cope with the dynamic
   trajectory optimization problem of the air-ground network, the
   interaction between entities is modeled as a Markov game firstly. Then,
   the model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is adopted to
   optimize individual decision-making. This enables agents to learn the
   mobile patterns of others, so as to optimize their own mobile strategy.
   However, there are some common issues when executing the benchmark MARL
   algorithms, such as biased estimation and local optimum. To solve these
   problems, an enhanced multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm
   is proposed with policy clipping and average evaluation to guarantee the
   fast convergence and accurate estimation. Simulations demonstrate that

   It allows the UAV base station, ground users and the aerial jammer to

Abstract = {Satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks have been
   introduced as enhanced approaches to provide dynamic control, massive
   connections and global coverage for future wireless communication
   systems. This paper considers a coordinated satellite-UAV communication
   system, where the UAV performs the environmental reconnaissance task
   with the assistance of satellites in a hostile jamming environment. To
   fulfill this task, the UAV needs to realize autonomous trajectory
   control and upload the collected data to the satellite. With the aid of
   the uploading data, the satellite builds the environment situation map
   integrating the beam quality, jamming status, and traffic distribution.
   Accordingly, we propose a closed-loop anti-jamming dynamic trajectory
   optimization approach, which is divided into three stages. Firstly, a
   coarse trajectory planning is made according to the limited prior
   information and preset points. Secondly, the flight control between two
   adjacent preset points is formulated as a Markov decision process, and
   reinforcement learning (RL) based automatic flying control algorithms
   are proposed to explore the unknown hostile environment and realize
   autonomous and precise trajectory control. Thirdly, based on the
   collected data during the UAV's flight, the satellite utilizes an
   environment situation estimating algorithm to build an environment

   Then, security threats and attacks are analyzed and categorized from the

   jamming attacks, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, eavesdropping attacks,
   side-channel attacks, manipulation attacks, and system intrusion
   attacks. Countermeasures are categorized based on the UAV system
   architecture and what attacks each countermeasure type can defend are
   also summarized. Compared to existing survey on security of a UAV
   system, more attack types and corresponding countermeasures are

Abstract = {In blockchain-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication systems,
   the length of a block affects the performance of the blockchain. The
   transmission performance of blocks in the form of finite character
   segments is also affected by the block length. Therefore, it is crucial
   to balance the transmission performance and blockchain performance of
   blockchain communication systems, especially in wireless environments
   involving UAVs. This paper investigates a secure transmission scheme for
   blocks in blockchain-based UAV communication systems to prevent the
   information contained in blocks from being completely eavesdropped
   during transmission. In our scheme, using a friendly jamming UAV to emit
   jamming signals diminishes the quality of the eavesdropping channel,
   thus enhancing the communication security performance of the source UAV.
   Under the constraints of maneuverability and transmission power of the
   UAV, the joint design of UAV trajectories, transmission power, and block
   length are proposed to maximize the average minimum secrecy rate (AMSR).
   Since the optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to solve
   directly, we first decompose the optimization problem into subproblems
   of trajectory optimization, transmission power optimization, and block
   length optimization. Then, based on first- order approximation
   techniques, these subproblems are reformulated as convex optimization
   problems. Finally, we utilize an alternating iteration algorithm based
   on the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to solve these
   subproblems iteratively. The simulation results demonstrate that our
   proposed scheme can achieve secure transmission for blocks while
   maintaining the performance of the blockchain.},

Abstract = {The integration of electronic reconnaissance platforms and payloads in
   the electromagnetic and spatial domains of cognition is necessary for
   the successful execution of cognitive electronic reconnaissance
   missions. However, in partially observable environments, platforms and
   payloads interact in separate operational domains, making it a challenge
   for the model. The authors create a theoretical model of cognitive
   electronic reconnaissance, present an analysis method of model elements
   and derives adequate requirements for optimal radiation source sorting
   or recognition. Then, a 3D cognitive reconnaissance simulator `Scouter'
   to simulate the dynamic interaction process of space electronic
   reconnaissance missions is developed and a deep reinforcement learning
   framework to optimise the electronic reconnaissance strategies of
   Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is designed. For the first time, a method
   for judging reconnaissance area coverage using a behavioural angle is
   proposed. This method enables a deep reinforcement learning-based UAV
   with better reconnaissance behaviours and to realise the stable
   targeting of the target by the receiving antenna beam during
   reconnaissance. Moreover, the fast convergence of UAV agent training is
   ensured through the normalisation of partially observable status and
   reward shaping. Verified by adequate numerical simulations, a trained
   UAV can complete a 100 reconnaissance cycles mission with a completion
   rate of 91.9\%. Even after the reconnaissance cycles are prolonged to
   600, the mission completion rate can still be maintained at 78.5\%. The
   most satisfying aspect is that the UAV comprehends the idea of
   reconnaissance and behaves in a way that is typical of it, such as by
   reciprocating or circling the edge of the radar's detecting power.
   The authors create a theoretical model of cognitive electronic
   reconnaissance and derives adequate requirements for optimal radiation
   source sorting or recognition. Then, develop a 3D cognitive
   reconnaissance simulator `Scouter' to simulate the dynamic interaction
   process of space electronic reconnaissance missions is developed, and a
   deep reinforcement learning framework to optimise the electronic
   reconnaissance strategies of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is designed.
   For the first time, a method for judging reconnaissance area coverage
   using a behavioural angle is proposed. Comparing the simulation results,
   it can be seen that after training the UAV has gained insights into the
   concept of reconnaissance and learnt the radar detection power and
   flying or reciprocating around outside the radar detection power is the
   more favoured reconnaissance by the UAV strategy.image},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology,
   UAVs are gaining increasing importance in civilian, industrial, and
   military applications. UAVs are used for environmental monitoring,

Title = {A Survey on Trajectory Planning and Resource Allocation in Unmanned
   Aerial Vehicle-assisted Edge Computing Networks},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS \& INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {47},

Abstract = {Significance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-assisted Mobile Edge Computing
   (UAV-MEC) is recognized for its flexible deployment, rapid response,
   wide-area coverage, and distributed computing capabilities,
   demonstrating significant potential in smart cities, environmental
   monitoring, and emergency rescue. Traditional ground-based MEC systems,
   constrained by fixed edge server deployments, are inadequate for dynamic
   user distributions and remote area demands. The integration of UAVs with
   MEC is a critical advancement, where dynamic trajectory planning and
   resource allocation enhance network energy efficiency, computational
   efficiency, and service quality, supporting the development of
   low-altitude intelligent networking. This integration addresses the
   efficient offloading and real-time processing of computation-intensive
   tasks through air-ground collaborative optimization, providing
   foundational technical support for future 6G networks and low-altitude
   economies. Existing surveys in this field predominantly focus on the
   integration of UAVs and MEC from a resource allocation perspective,
   while trajectory planning and its joint optimization with resource
   allocation are largely overlooked. Furthermore, the distinctions between
   online and offline optimization are insufficiently addressed in existing
   surveys, necessitating a systematic analysis of current theories and
   methods to guide future research. Progress In UAV-MEC, joint
   optimization of trajectory planning and resource allocation has
   progressed in both online and offline domains. Algorithm frameworks,
   including alternating optimization and reinforcement learning, have been
   shown to effectively balance computational complexity with optimization
   performance. (1) Offline optimization: (a) Energy efficiency
   optimization: Existing studies employ alternating optimization methods,
   such as Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) and Successive Convex
   Approximation (SCA), as well as heuristic algorithms, including
   differential evolution and dynamic programming, to jointly optimize
   trajectories, task offloading, and resource allocation, minimizing
   energy consumption for both users and UAVs. Further reductions in system
   energy consumption are achieved by integrating Wireless Power Transfer
   (WPT) and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). (b) Latency
   optimization: Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) and task scheduling
   strategies are utilized to minimize user-perceived latency. A multi-UAV
   collaborative framework based on game theory and reinforcement learning
   is proposed. (c) Multi-objective optimization: The Dinkelbach method is
   introduced to address fractional programming problems, facilitating
   joint optimization of computational efficiency, throughput, and secure
   capacity. Digital Twin (DT) technology is integrated to approximate
   global optimality. (2) Online optimization: (a) Lyapunov framework:
   Long-term stochastic problems are decoupled into per-slot optimizations
   through temporal decomposition. Convex optimization is combined with
   dynamic trajectory and resource allocation adjustments to adapt to
   time-varying channels and user mobility. (b) Reinforcement learning:
   Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) is applied to multi-UAV
   collaboration, with expert knowledge guidance and noise injection
   incorporated to accelerate algorithm convergence. (3) Hybrid
   optimization: A ``pre-planning + online adjustment{''} strategy is
   proposed. In the offline phase, clustering algorithms and particle swarm
   optimization are used to generate high-quality samples for training Deep
   Neural Networks (DNNs).
   In the online phase, incremental learning is applied to dynamically
   fine-tune DNNs for unknown scenarios, balancing global planning with
   real-time responsiveness. Conclusions Despite notable advancements,
   several critical challenges in UAV-assisted MEC remain unresolved: (1)
   Incomplete future state information: The formulation of offline
   optimization problems typically assumes full knowledge of environmental
   state information over future time horizons. However, in multi-UAV
   scenarios involving multi-dimensional parameters, acquiring complete and
   accurate state information across extended periods remains difficult,
   limiting the applicability of offline methods. (2) Real-time multi-UAV
   coordination: Enhancing system efficiency and task completion quality
   requires real-time coordination among UAVs. This process demands
   extensive information exchange within UAV swarms, complex obstacle
   avoidance, and high-dimensional control adjustments. Collaborative
   computation offloading and multi-UAV trajectory planning remain
   challenging due to their inherent complexity. (3) Security
   vulnerabilities in air-ground links: The line-of-sight propagation and
   open transmission environment of UAV-assisted MEC networks expose
   offloaded data to risks such as eavesdropping, data tampering, and
   signal interference. Current approaches predominantly rely on
   physical-layer security, whereas active defense mechanisms against
   emerging threats, including deep-fake signal attacks, are still
   underdeveloped. (4) Lack of integration across air-space-ground
   networks: The absence of standardized interfaces and unified
   cross-domain resource scheduling protocols hinders the coordination of
   spectrum, computing, and caching resources between satellites and
   UAV-MEC systems. This limitation restricts the realization of globally
   orchestrated heterogeneous networks. (5) Energy constraints and service
   quality tradeoff: UAV endurance directly affects service coverage and
   operational sustainability. Although energy efficiency is emphasized in
   both offline and online optimization strategies, a fundamental tradeoff
   persists between energy consumption and edge service quality. These
   technical bottlenecks continue to restrict the transition of UAV-MEC
   from theoretical frameworks to large-scale real-world deployment.
   Prospects Future research is expected to progress in the following
   directions: (1) Intelligent environmental perception will advance
   through the integration of Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) or Temporal
   Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for dynamic parameter prediction, while
   Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) will be leveraged to complement
   incomplete environmental state information. (2) Multi-UAV collaboration
   and energy efficiency will be enhanced through the development of
   service migration mechanisms and DT-driven MADRL frameworks, combined
   with solar/WPT technologies to improve UAV endurance. (3) Secure
   communication mechanisms will evolve with the combination of
   beamforming, physical-layer security techniques, and homomorphic
   encryption-based task offloading protocols to address eavesdropping and
   data tampering in air-ground channels. (4) Heterogeneous network
   integration will focus on exploring a ``cloud-edge-device-satellite{''}
   architecture to expand UAV-MEC coverage and robustness in 6G networks,
   with the development of satellites-assisted cross-domain resource
   scheduling algorithms.
   (5) Green computing paradigms will emerge through the integration of
   energy harvesting and service migration mechanisms to reduce computing
   loads, promoting sustainable low-altitude intelligent computing
   ecosystems.},

Title = {Energy Aware Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted Unmanned Aerial
   Vehicle Age of Information Enabled Data Collection Policies},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS \& INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {47},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Objective This study aims to develop and implement an optimization
   framework that addresses the critical balance between energy consumption
   and information freshness in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted
   Internet of Things (IoT) data collection systems, enhanced by
   Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). In complex urban
   environments, traditional line-of-sight communication between UAVs and
   ground-based IoT devices is often obstructed by buildings and
   infrastructure, hindering comprehensive coverage and efficient data
   collection. While RIS technology offers promising solutions by
   dynamically adjusting signal reflection directions, optimizing
   communication signal coverage, and enhancing quality, it introduces
   additional complexity in system design and resource allocation,
   requiring sophisticated adaptive optimization techniques. The
   integration of RIS enables stable communication connections across
   various UAV flight heights and angles, mitigating disruptions caused by
   obstacles or signal interference, thus improving data collection
   efficiency and reliability. However, this integration must account for
   multiple factors, including UAV energy consumption, communication
   complexity, and Age of Information (AoI) constraints. These approaches
   must adapt to the dynamic nature of UAV operations and fluctuating
   communication conditions, ensuring optimal performance in terms of
   energy efficiency and data freshness. The research also addresses
   several key challenges, including real-time adaptation to environmental
   changes, optimal scheduling of IoT device interactions, dynamic
   adjustment of RIS phase configurations, efficient trajectory planning,
   and the maintenance of data freshness under various system constraints.
   The proposed framework establishes a robust foundation for
   next-generation IoT data collection systems that can adapt to diverse
   operational conditions while maintaining high performance standards.
   This is achieved through the implementation of advanced deep
   reinforcement learning techniques, specifically designed to manage the
   complex interplay between UAV mobility, RIS configuration, and IoT
   device scheduling, ensuring efficient and timely data collection while
   optimizing system resources. Methods A comprehensive data collection
   optimization strategy is proposed, based on deep reinforcement learning
   principles, specifically designed to address the complex challenges in
   UAV-assisted IoT data collection systems enhanced by RIS technology. The
   methodology employs a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) architecture,
   integrating UAV trajectory planning, IoT device scheduling, and RIS
   phase adjustment within a three-dimensional grid-based movement space.
   The system incorporates a channel model that accounts for both direct
   and RIS-assisted communication paths, including a probabilistic path
   loss model for direct links and Rician fading for RIS-assisted links.
   The optimization problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process
   (MDP), where the state space includes the UAV position, previous
   movement information, and average AoI, while the action space involves
   3D movement decisions and IoT device scheduling. The reward function is
   designed to balance multiple performance metrics, including system AoI,
   UAV flight energy consumption, data collection energy, data upload
   energy, and penalties for boundary violations. The DDQN implementation
   utilizes two Q-networks-the current and target networks-separating
   action selection from action evaluation, effectively addressing the
   issue of Q-value overestimation.
   The training process incorporates experience replay for sample storage
   and periodic updates to the target network to enhance learning
   stability. Additionally, the RIS phase shift optimization is derived
   through geometric relationships, considering both direct and RIS
   assisted communication paths. This comprehensive approach enables the
   joint optimization of UAV trajectory, IoT device scheduling, and RIS
   phase adjustment, while ensuring energy efficiency and timely data
   collection in complex communication environments. Results and
   Discussions The proposed method enables the UAV to dynamically adjust
   its flight trajectory and communication strategy based on real-time
   environmental conditions, enhancing data transmission efficiency while
   reducing energy consumption. Extensive simulation experiments
   comprehensively evaluate the performance of the DDQN-based optimization
   framework. Convergence analysis demonstrates that the method achieves
   faster and more stable convergence compared to traditional DQN
   approaches. The average reward steadily increases and stabilizes after
   approximately 200 episodes, while baseline methods exhibit slower
   convergence and higher performance variance (Fig. 3). The optimized UAV
   trajectory visualization shows that the method effectively guides the
   UAV to collect data efficiently from all IoT devices while avoiding
   unnecessary detours. The trajectory strikes a balance between visiting
   high-priority devices (those with higher AoI) and maintaining
   energy-efficient flight paths, clearly illustrating the effectiveness of
   the joint optimization of movement and device scheduling decisions (Fig.
   4). Energy consumption analysis reveals that the proposed method
   achieves superior energy efficiency, with a 15\% reduction in total
   energy consumption while maintaining comparable data collection
   performance. This improvement results from the intelligent integration
   of RIS-assisted communication and optimal trajectory planning, which
   reduces the need for energy-intensive maneuvers and prolonged hovering
   periods (Fig. 5) (Fig. 6). The AoI performance evaluation further
   confirms the method's effectiveness in maintaining data freshness. The
   average AoI across all IoT devices remains consistently lower than in
   baseline methods, with a 20\% improvement in worst-case AoI values. This
   demonstrates the method's ability to balance the trade-off between
   visiting different devices and maintaining acceptable AoI levels, even
   under challenging network conditions. The framework's adaptive nature is
   evident in its capacity to prioritize devices with critical AoI values
   while maintaining overall system efficiency, showing robust performance
   across varying network densities and device distributions (Fig. 5) (Fig.
   6). Conclusions The proposed deep reinforcement learning-based
   optimization policy effectively addresses the complex challenges in
   UAV-assisted IoT data collection systems enhanced by RIS technology,
   demonstrating significant improvements in both energy efficiency and
   information freshness. The integration of advanced learning techniques
   with RIS-assisted communication provides a robust and adaptive solution
   for practical deployment in urban IoT environments. The comprehensive
   evaluation framework and detailed performance analysis offer valuable
   insights for system designers and practitioners. The superior
   performance in terms of convergence speed, trajectory optimization,
   energy efficiency, and AoI management confirms the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach.
   Future research will focus on extending the framework to multi-UAV
   coordination scenarios, exploring the impact of dynamic environmental
   changes, and developing more sophisticated reward mechanisms to address
   additional operational constraints, such as security and airspace
   restrictions. The promising results also indicate potential applications
   in emergency response systems, smart city infrastructure, and
   environmental monitoring networks.},

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networking and collaboration have
   significant prospects in both civilian and military applications, due to
   its remarkable properties in cooperative efficiency, reduced risks, and
   operational cost. Traditional algorithms have challenging issues of high
   computational complexity and low efficiency in UAV swarm networking and
   collaboration, while computational intelligence (CI) has attracted
   increasing attention since it has advantages in solving complex
   optimization problems. The networking of UAV swarms serves as an
   essential foundation for collaboration, and intelligent collaboration is
   a crucial means of enhancing the performance of UAV swarm systems. To
   date, extensive CI-based algorithms have been proposed to improve the
   networking and collaboration capabilities of UAV swarms, and several
   relevant surveys have also been presented. However, existing surveys
   either review networking or collaboration. To the best of our knowledge,
   there is no survey that simultaneously concentrates on CI-based UAV
   swarm networking and collaboration. In this survey, we provide a
   comprehensive overview of CI-based networking and collaboration
   algorithms from six typical aspects including channel access, network
   routing, cooperative task assignment, cooperative path planning,
   cooperative search, and cooperative jamming. More importantly, to help
   researchers choose appropriate algorithms to satisfy the requirements of
   different missions, we classify CI-based algorithms into four
   categories, namely heuristic behavior search-based algorithms, policy
   design-based algorithms, policy learning-based algorithms, and hybrid
   algorithms. Finally, we discuss open issues and future directions that
   may influence future research on UAV swarm intelligence networking and

Abstract = {This paper proposes an integrated sensing, navigation, and communication
   (ISNC) framework for safeguarding unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled
   wireless networks against a mobile eavesdropping UAV (E-UAV). To cope
   with the mobility of the E-UAV, the proposed framework advocates the
   dual use of artificial noise transmitted by the information UAV (I-UAV)
   for simultaneous jamming and sensing to facilitate navigation and secure
   communication. In particular, the I-UAV communicates with legitimate
   downlink ground users, while avoiding potential information leakage by
   emitting jamming signals, and estimates the state of the E-UAV with an
   extended Kalman filter based on the backscattered jamming signals.
   Exploiting the estimated state of the E-UAV in the previous time slot,
   the I-UAV determines its flight planning strategy, predicts the wiretap
   channel, and designs its communication resource allocation policy for
   the next time slot. To circumvent the severe coupling between these
   three tasks, a divide-and-conquer approach is adopted. The online
   navigation design has the objective to minimize the distance between the
   I-UAV and a pre-defined destination point considering kinematic and
   geometric constraints. Subsequently, given the predicted wiretap
   channel, the robust resource allocation design is formulated as an
   optimization problem to achieve the optimal trade-off between sensing
   and communication in the next time slot, while taking into account the
   wiretap channel prediction error and the quality-of-service (QoS)
   requirements of secure communication. To account for the E-UAV state
   sensing uncertainty and the resulting wiretap channel prediction error,
   we employ a fully-connected neural network to model the complicated
   mapping between the state estimation error variance and an upper bound
   on the channel prediction error, which facilitates the development of a
   low-complexity suboptimal user scheduling and precoder design algorithm.
   Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
   design compared with baseline schemes and validate the benefits of
   integrating sensing and navigation into secure UAV communication
   systems. We reveal that the dual use of artificial noise can improve
   both sensing and jamming and that navigation is more important for
   improving the trade-off between sensing and communications than
   communication resource allocation.},

Abstract = {This paper exploits the mobility of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to
   improve the physical layer (PLS) security against potential
   eavesdropping scenarios, where the sensitive data transmitted from a
   ground base station (GBS) to multiple information receivers (IRs) is
   easily eavesdropped by multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers (Eves).
   Specifically, the UAV is employed as a friendly jammer to transmit
   artificial noise to degrade the wiretap channels. By leveraging the
   UAV's mobility and the possibility of establishing line-of-sight links,
   the UAV can move close to the Eves and opportunistically jam them.
   Especially, two practical factors, namely, the imperfect location
   information of Eves and the existence of no-fly zones are considered.
   Since only the partial position information of the Eves can be known, as
   the worst case, the minimum average secrecy rate of IRs is robustly
   optimized by jointly designing the trajectory and jamming power of the
   UAV, and the transmission power of the GBS to ensure the security of all
   IRs. However, the formulated problem with coupled variables is
   non-convex and intractable. As such, an efficient alternative iterative
   suboptimal algorithm is proposed to solve this problem by applying the
   block coordinate descent, successive convex approximation, slack
   variables, and \$\textbackslash{}mathcal \{S\}\$-Procedure. Numerical
   results reveal that the proposed robust algorithm can substantially
   improve the max-min average secrecy rate, and the effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithm is further verified by comparing it with three
   benchmark schemes.},

Abstract = {Future UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) operations in urban environments
   demand a PNT (position, navigation, and timing) solution that is both
   robust and resilient. While a GNSS (global navigation satellite system)
   can provide an accurate position under open-sky assumptions, the
   complexity of urban operations leads to NLOS (non-line-of-sight) and

   key research question within the research community pertains to
   determining the appropriate hybrid fusion architecture that can ensure
   the resilience and continuity of UAV operations in urban environments,
   minimizing significant degradations of PNT data. In this context, we

   barometer to cope with the GNSS multipath and positioning performance
   degradation. Within the federated fusion architecture, local filters are
   implemented using EKFs (extended Kalman filters), while a master filter
   is used in the form of a GRU (gated recurrent unit) block. Data
   collection is performed by setting up a virtual environment in AirSim
   for the visual odometry aid and barometer data, while Spirent GSS7000

   range of degraded conditions while maintaining a good level of

Abstract = {This article investigates a dual-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted
   short-packet covert communication system in the presence of a warden.
   Specifically, one flying UAV serves as the base station to transmit
   covert information to a legitimate ground user, and the other flying UAV
   is deployed as a cooperative jammer to transmit artificial noise against
   detection by a warden. Considering a more practical scenario, where only
   imperfect location information of the warden is known at both UAVs, we
   jointly optimize both UAVs' transmit powers and 3-D trajectories to
   maximize the average covert transmission rate under the constraints of
   both UAVs' mobility, transmit powers and warden's detection error
   probability (DEP). On the one hand, the incomplete Gamma function
   involved in warden's DEP makes the covertness constraint intractable for
   further analysis. To facilitate the design, warden's DEP is lower
   bounded by Pinsker's inequality. On the other hand, the formulated
   optimization problem is intractable to solve directly owing to the
   multiple highly coupled variables and the uncertainty of the warden's
   location. The alternating optimization algorithm combined with the
   successive convex approximation and \$\textbackslash{}mathcal \{S\}\$
   -procedure techniques is leveraged to solve three optimization
   subproblems iteratively. Numerical results reveal that superior
   performance can be achieved by employing the proposed joint optimization
   of both UAVs' transmit powers and 3-D trajectories algorithm compared
   with the traditional 2-D trajectory optimization algorithm and the
   scheme without the assistance of the cooperative UAV.},

Title = {Dynamic UAV Swarm Collaboration for Multi-Targets Tracking Under
   Malicious Jamming: Joint Power, Path and Target Association Optimization},

Abstract = {In this paper, the multi-target tracking (MTT) with an unmanned aerial
   vehicle (UAV) swarm is investigated in the presence of jammers, where
   UAVs in the swarm communicate with each other to exchange information of
   targets during tracking. The communication between UAVs suffers from
   severe interference, including inter-UAV interference and jamming, thus
   leading to a deteriorated quality of MTT. To mitigate the interference
   and achieve MTT, we formulate an interference minimization problem by
   jointly optimizing UAV's sub-swarm division, trajectory, and power,
   subject to the constraint of MTT, collision prevention, flying ability,
   and UAV energy consumption. Due to the multiple coupling of sub-swarm
   division, trajectory, and power, the proposed optimization problem is
   NP-hard. To solve this challenging problem, it is decomposed into three
   subproblems, i.e., target association, path plan, and power control.
   First, a cluster-evolutionary target association (CETA) algorithm is
   proposed, which involves dividing the UAV swarm into multiple sub-swarms
   and individually matching these sub-swarms to targets. Second, a
   jamming-sensitive and singular case tolerance (JSSCT)-artificial
   potential field (APF) algorithm is proposed to plan trajectory for
   tracking the targets. Third, we develop a jamming-aware mean field game
   (JA-MFG) power control scheme, where a novel cost function is
   established considering the total interference. Finally, to minimize the
   total interference, a dynamic collaboration approach is designed.
   Different from traditional alternative iteration algorithms, our
   proposed dynamic collaboration approach triggers the updates of the
   sub-swarm division and UAV trajectory, and periodically updates the
   transmission power. Simulation results validate that the proposed
   dynamic collaboration approach reduces average total interference,
   tracking steps, and target switching times by 28\%, 33\%, and 48\%,
   respectively, comparing to existing baselines.},

Abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) jammer localization refers to the process
   of determining the optimal location for a UAV jammer to be placed to
   interfere with an eavesdropper's communication with a target. In fact,
   the main goal is to maximize the jamming signal power at the
   eavesdropper's position while minimizing the jamming signal power at the

   model is composed with an UAV jammer, two ground nodes and an
   illegitimate user with unknown position. True uniform random deployment
   processes is used to model the randomness of the eavesdropper location.
   Further, a novel summed secrecy approach is proposed to determine the
   overall optimal UAV position. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of
   the novel approach versus other benchmark algorithms across various

Abstract = {The integrated communication and jamming system is proposed by
   exploiting the diversity gain and flexible deployment of unmanned aerial
   vehicle (UAV)-based distributed multiple input multiple output
   technology, which is expected to gain higher spectral efficiency and
   system scalability. This paper designs transmit beamforming of multiple
   UAVs so that they can simultaneously impose jamming signal to jamming
   targets and communication signal to communication users at the same
   frequency. The aim is to maximize the total jamming effect of all
   jamming targets while achieving a certain communication rate of
   communication users by optimizing the transmit beamforming matrices. Two
   cases are considered in which the UAV swarm works in clock
   synchronization and clock asynchronization. Specifically, the problem is
   formulated into a non-convex optimization in the synchronous case. A
   near optimal solution is derived by decoupling the beamforming matrix
   into multi-user interference suppression matrix and single-user
   beamforming matrix. In the asynchronous case, the transmitter-receiver
   matching relation needs to consider and multiple optimization variables
   are highly coupled, penalty factors and intermediate variables to
   convert the optimization problem to convex programming are introduced.
   The simulation results show that the proposed beamforming design
   algorithm coordinates the communication and jamming signal rationally
   and outperforms the conventional beamforming design algorithms.

Title = {Rate splitting multiple access for UAV Secure Communication Systems with

Journal = {PHYSICAL COMMUNICATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {66},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {A rate splitting multiple access (RSMA)-based dual-unmanned aerial
   vehicle (UAV) secure communication system is proposed in this paper,
   where one UAV is deployed to communicate with ground users, while the
   other UAV is dispatched to transmit the jamming signal to a ground
   eavesdropper. Considering the limited energy of UAV batteries, the
   minimum secrecy rate is maximized via optimizing RSMA precoding matrix
   and trajectories of UAVs under the constraint of UAV energy consumption.
   To address the complexity arising from coupled variables, the
   optimization problem is decomposed into two equivalent subproblems:
   precoding matrix optimization and UAV trajectory design. This
   decomposition is achieved using the block coordinate descent method.
   Next, the subproblems are transformed into convex forms by using
   semidefinite relaxation and successive convex approximation techniques,
   which are iteratively solved until convergence. Simulation results show
   that the secrecy performance of RSMA scheme is superior to that of the
   benchmark schemes, Specifically, the average secrecy rate of the RSMA
   scheme is approximately 22\% and 10.8\% higher than that of the NOMA and

Abstract = {High altitude platforms (HAPs) are emerging as the critical enabler for
   the next generation communication system, due to their broad coverage,
   long endurance and high payload. However, the open and broadcast nature
   of wireless links makes HAP system susceptible to information
   eavesdropping. This paper investigates the secure downlink transmission
   for an HAP network, where one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jammer is
   utilized against multiple mobile eavesdroppers (Eves) with imperfect
   location information. We aim to maximize the minimum average secrecy
   rate (MASR) by jointly optimizing subcarrier scheduling, subcarrier
   power allocation, UAV trajectory and HAP deployment. To address the
   formulated mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, we first
   derive the optimal HAP deployment and utilize an estimation error model
   to resolve the locational uncertainty of the Eves. Subsequently, a
   low-complexity iterative algorithm is proposed, which decomposes the
   problem into three manageable subproblems and iteratively solves them to
   obtain a near-optimal solution. The convergence and complexity of the
   algorithm are further analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate that the
   proposed scheme significantly improves not only the MASR but also the
   fairness between terminal devices, which outperforms the baselines

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled air-ground integrated

Abstract = {Based on the high positioning accuracy, low cost and low-power
   consumption, the ultra-wide-band (UWB) is an ideal solution for indoor
   unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization and navigation. However, the
   UWB signals are easy to be blocked or reflected by obstacles such as
   walls and furniture. A resilient tightly-coupled inertial navigation
   system (INS)/UWB integration is proposed and implemented for indoor UAV
   navigation in this paper. A factor graph optimization (FGO) method
   enhanced by resilient stochastic model is established to cope with the
   indoor challenging scenarios. To deal with the impact of UWB
   non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals and noise uncertainty, the conventional
   neural net-works (CNNs) are introduced into the stochastic modelling to
   improve the resilience and reliability of the integration. Based on the
   status that the UWB features are limited, a `two-phase' CNNs structure
   was designed and implemented: one for signal classification and the
   other one for measurement noise prediction. The proposed resilient FGO
   method is tested on flighting UAV platform under actual indoor
   challenging scenario. Compared to classical FGO method, the overall
   positioning errors can be decreased from about 0.60 m to
   centimeter-level under signal block and reflection scenarios. The
   superiority of resilient FGO which effectively verified in constrained
   environment is pretty important for positioning accuracy and integrity

Abstract = {In this paper, we study a novel joint information-theoretic secrecy and
   covertness model for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted finite
   blocklength transmission system, in which an UAV delivers classified
   information to a ground user (Bob) in the presence of two unauthorized
   users (Eve and Willie). Specifically, Eve tries to decode the legitimate
   information while Willie tries to detect if the UAV's transmission is
   present or not. Firstly, we assume that the perfect location knowledge
   of both Eve and Willie is known at the UAV. In this scenario, to
   guarantee security and covertness, the average secrecy rate maximization
   problem is formulated via joint design of the UAV's transmit power and
   three dimensional (3D) trajectory under Willie's covertness constraint.
   Technically speaking, the optimization problem is non-convex and
   mathematically intractable to tackle owing to the coupling of multiple
   variables. To address this non-convex problem, an iterative alternating
   optimization (AO) algorithm is developed with the assistance of the
   successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. After that, we extend
   the system model to both Eve's and Willie's imperfect location knowledge
   case, which is more sophisticated compared to the perfect location
   knowledge case due to the uncertain location constraints. We still
   utilize the iterative AO algorithm combined with SCA and S-procedure
   techniques to cope with the nonconvex problem. Numerical results
   indicate that our proposed 3D optimization algorithm performs better
   than the conventional two dimensional (2D) scheme and the benchmark
   scheme for both perfect and imperfect location knowledge cases.},

Abstract = {The cognitive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system has
   emerged as a pivotal technology in addressing the scarcity of spectral
   resources for UAV communications, but the jamming and eavesdropping
   attacks are severe due to the high-quality air-to-ground communication
   links. Consequently, this paper introduces a UAV-enabled cooperative
   jammer to disrupt the eavesdropping activities of active eavesdroppers
   by emitting artificial noise. Our objective is to jointly optimize the
   three-dimensional UAV trajectory and transmit power to maximize the
   secrecy communication rate under quality of service (QoS) requirement.
   To tackle the non-convex problem, the block coordinate descent (BCD) and
   successive convex approximation (SCA) methods are utilized to transform
   it into an approximate convex problem, and then we design an alternative
   optimization iterative algorithm to achieve suboptimal but efficient
   solution. Moreover, we extend the developed algorithm into an imperfect
   channel state information (CSI) scenario to maximize the worst-case
   secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the robust UAV's trajectory and
   transmit power, where the location uncertainties of ground primary,
   secondary, and eavesdropping devices are considered. Simulation results

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication is recognized as a
   promising technique in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to address the issue
   of ineffective transmission of road condition data and driving
   instructions caused by obstruction and random fading of ground channels.
   However, the inherently open channel characteristics in UAV to ground
   links brings new secure and covert problem in vehicular IoV which
   largely limit the applications of UAV in IoV. To resolve the issue, this
   work studies a UAV-enabled covert autonomous vehicular communication
   network where a UAV is deployed as a relay aided by a jammer to assist
   the data transmission from the base station to an autonomous vehicle
   without being detected by a warden whose exact location is unknown. For
   network performance boosting with transmission covertness consideration,
   an upload throughput maximization problem is formulated by jointly
   designing UAV trajectory and resource allocation under a more generally
   joint covertness constraints. To solve the complicated and highly
   non-convex problem which contains a large number of variables, we first
   analyze the detection performance and derives the closed-form
   expressions of the warden's minimal detection error probability
   considering the warden's location uncertainty. Then, the
   characterizations on the convexity of minimal detection error
   probability and the optimal transmission rate are provided, which helps
   in simplifying original problem and developing an efficient iterative
   algorithm to solve this problem based on a proposed novel convex
   approximation method. Simulations are offered to demonstrate the
   superior convergence, throughput, computation time, and covertness
   performance of proposed scheme in UAV-enabled vehicular network.},

Abstract = {With the widespread application of communication technology in the
   non-terrestrial network (NTN), the issue of the insecure communication
   due to the inherent openness of the NTN is increasingly being
   recognized. Consequently, safeguarding communication information in the
   NTN has emerged as a critical challenge. To address this issue, we
   propose a beamforming and horizontal trajectory joint optimization
   method for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) covert communications in the
   NTN. First, we formulate an optimization problem that considers
   constraints such as the transmitting power and the distance. Moreover,
   we employ the integrated communication and jamming (ICAJ) signal as
   Alice's transmitting signal, further protecting the content of
   communication information. Next, we construct two subproblems, and we
   propose an alternate optimization (AO) algorithm based on quadratic
   transform and penalty term method to solve the proposed two subproblems.
   Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and

Abstract = {Reliable and continuous position is critical for a Low-altitude Unmanned
   Aerial Vehicle (UAV), the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can
   generate navigation solutions. However, navigation solutions from the
   GNSS are not always reliable due to the possible signal jamming,
   interference and blockage. In view of the drawbacks, in this paper, we
   proposed a GNSS/Visual integrated navigation system for low-altitude UAV
   under signal challenging environments. The visual positing system (VPS)
   is composed of a front-end visual odometry and back-end aerial-satellite
   images matching based absolute position module. In the front-end task,
   the consecutive top-view aerial images from UAV cameras are matched
   frameby-frame to realize the relative motion estimation; in the back-end
   task, satellite remote sensing images after fine calibration are matched
   with the top-view UAV aerial images to estimate the absolute position.
   Deep learning methods XFeat and SuperGlue are utilized in the front-end
   and back-end individually. Front-end and back-end modules in the VPS
   work cooperatively to generate position, which is then integrated with
   the GNSS using Adaptive Factor Graph Optimization (AFGO) to realize more
   reliable position information. The performance of the proposed method
   was evaluated through four long-distance flight tests, with an average
   position error of approximately 10.14 meters. When a GNSS outage was
   introduced along the flight path, the system can still output
   positioning result with the VPS. The experimental results demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {Ensuring secure communication in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks
   is a critical challenge due to vulnerabilities such as GNSS (Global
   Navigation Satellite System) spoofing, jamming, and unauthorized data

   technology as a decentralized and immutable framework for enhancing UAV
   communication security. A blockchain-based GNSS spoofing detection
   system is designed, implemented, and validated within a simulated
   environment integrating AirSim, Ethereum blockchain (Ganache), smart
   contract (Solidity), and Python-based UAV simulations. The proposed
   system employs a consensus mechanism among UAVs to detect anomalous GNSS
   data and mitigate spoofing attacks in real-time. Performance evaluation
   metrics-transaction latency, blockchain throughput, gas consumption,
   detection accuracy, storage usage, and energy consumption-demonstrate
   the system's capability to securely validate UAV location data. Findings
   indicate that blockchain ensures data integrity and resilience against
   cyber threats, though challenges related to transaction latency,
   scalability and computational overhead persist. The study contributes to
   the field of aerospace cybersecurity and IoT-based UAV networks by

Abstract = {Unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV)-aided data collection for Internet of
   Things applications has attracted increasing attention. This paper
   investigates motion planning for UAV collecting low-power ground sensor
   node (SN) data in a dynamic jamming environment. We targeted minimizing
   the flight energy consumption via optimization of the UAV trajectory
   while considering the indispensable constraints which cover the
   collection data demodulation threshold, obstacle avoidance, data
   collection volume, and motion principle. Firstly, we formulate the
   UAV-aided data collection problem as an energy consumption minimization
   problem. To solve this nonconvex optimization problem, we rewrite the
   original problem by introducing relaxation variables and constructing
   equivalence constraints to obtain a new relaxation convex problem, which
   can be solved iteratively using the successive convex approximation
   (SCA) method. However, SCA is susceptible to initial values, especially
   in dynamic environments where fixed initial values may lead to a wide
   range of results, making it difficult to obtain a truly optimal solution
   to the optimization problem. To solve the initial value problem in
   dynamic environments, we further propose a
   communication-flight-corridor(CFC)-based initial path generation method
   to improve the reliability and convergence speed of the SCA method by
   constructing reliable communication regions and resilient secure paths
   in real time. Finally, simulation results validate the performance of
   the proposed algorithm compared to the benchmark algorithms under
   different parameter configurations.},

Abstract = {This article proposes a cooperative friendly jamming framework for swarm
   unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying
   networks with wireless energy harvesting (EH). In particular, we
   consider a swarm of hovering UAVs that relays information from a
   terrestrial base station to a distant mobile user and simultaneously
   generates friendly jamming signals to interfere/obfuscate an
   eavesdropper. Due to the limited energy of the UAVs, we develop a
   collaborative time-switching relaying protocol that allows the UAVs to
   collaborate in harvesting wireless energy, relay information, and jam
   the eavesdropper. To evaluate the performance, we derive the secrecy
   outage probability (SOP) for two popular detection techniques at the
   eavesdropper, i.e., selection combining and maximum-ratio combining.
   Monte Carlo simulations are then used to validate the theoretical SOP
   derivation. Using the derived SOP, one can obtain engineering insights
   to optimize the EH time and the number of UAVs in the swarm to achieve a
   given secrecy protection level. Furthermore, simulations show the
   effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of SOP compared to the
   conventional AF relaying system. The analytical SOP derived in this work
   can also be helpful in future UAV secure-communication optimizations
   (e.g., trajectory and locations of UAVs). As an example, we present a
   case study to find the optimal corridor to locate the swarm so as to
   minimize the system SOP. Our proposed framework helps secure
   communications for various applications that require large coverage,
   e.g., industrial IoT, smart city, intelligent transportation systems,
   and critical IoT infrastructures, such as energy and water.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates a dual-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided
   communication system to improve the security of the communication

   ignored ground devices mobility and just considered one-way
   communication security between ground devices and UAVs, we allow the
   devices to be mobile and consider bi-directional ground-UAV
   communication security. Specifically, one UAV server communicates with
   mobile ground devices, and the other UAV jammer is invoked to confuse
   eavesdroppers. Our objective is to maximize the worst-case average
   secrecy rate by the joint optimization of UAV trajectory and sender
   transmit power. To achieve it, we first formulate the worst-case average
   secrecy rate maximization problem as a constrained Markov decision
   process (CMDP) under the constraints of UAV flight space, flight speed,
   energy capacity, anti-collision, and peak transmit power. Then, we
   design a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) based algorithm to
   solve the CMDP. Experiment results demonstrate that our joint
   optimization scheme can enhance the communication security in terms of
   the secrecy rate in both UAV-to-ground (U2G) case and ground-to-UAV

Abstract = {The combination of nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique and
   unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides an effective solution for
   achieving massive connections and improving spectrum efficiency.
   However, the related security risk becomes serious due to the
   line-of-sight (LoS) channels involved and high transmit power for weaker
   users in NOMA-UAV networks. In this article, a UAV-assisted NOMA
   transmission scheme is proposed to achieve secure downlink transmission
   via artificial jamming, where a UAV flies straightly to serve multiple
   ground users in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. During the
   flight, only the closest NOMA users are chosen to connect with the UAV
   in each time slot to achieve high LoS probability. To balance the
   security and transmission performance, the tradeoff between the jamming
   power and the sum rate is investigated by jointly optimizing the power
   allocation, the user scheduling and the UAV trajectory. The formulated
   problem is mixed-integer and nonconvex due to the coupled variables. To
   address this, we first decompose the problem into two subproblems of
   power allocation and trajectory optimization. Then, they are transformed
   into convex ones via the first-order Taylor expansion. After that, an
   iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the convex problem. Finally,
   numerical results show that the security of the network is well enhanced

Abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has emerged as a promising novel
   application for the Sixth-Generation (6G) wireless communication by

Abstract = {This paper studies a mobile jammer enabled secure unmanned aerial
   vehicle (UAV) communication network in the finite packet length
   scenario, where the external friendly jammer UAV will transmit jamming
   signal to deteriorate the quality of eavesdropping channel, and help to
   improve the secure communication performance of the source UAV.
   Specifically, an average effective secrecy rate (AESR) maximization
   problem is formulated by jointly designing the trajectories and transmit
   power of the source/jammer UAV subject to the UAVs' mobility constraints
   and power constraints. It is also verified that there exists a unique
   optimal packet error rate to maximize the AESR. The formulated problem
   is mathematically intractable, as it is nonconvex and involves coupled
   optimization variables. Therefore, we first decompose the trajectories
   and power optimization problem into four non-convex subproblems, and
   then transform them into standard convex problems by applying
   first-order Taylor expansion. Then, an efficient alternating
   optimization algorithm for AESR problem based on Bisection method and
   successive convex approximation (SCA) technology is presented by
   addressing the five subproblems iteratively. Simulation results are
   provided to verify that our proposed scheme can obtain considerable
   better AESR gain compared to other four benchmark schemes.},

Abstract = {An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided secure communication system is
   conceived and investigated, where the UAV transmits legitimate
   information to a ground user in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve).
   To guarantee the security, the UAV employs a power splitting approach,
   where its transmit power can be divided into two parts for transmitting
   confidential messages and artificial noise (AN), respectively. We aim to
   maximize the average secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the UAV's
   trajectory, the transmit power levels and the corresponding power
   splitting ratios allocated to different time slots during the whole
   flight time, subject to both the maximum UAV speed constraint, the total
   mobility energy constraint, the total transmit power constraint, and
   other related constraints. To efficiently tackle this non-convex
   optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm by blending the
   benefits of the block coordinate descent (BCD) method, the
   concave-convex procedure (CCCP) and the alternating direction method of
   multipliers (ADMM). Specially, we show that the proposed algorithm
   exhibits very low computational complexity and each of its updating
   steps can be formulated in a nearly closed form. Besides, it can be
   easily extended to the case of three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design.
   Our simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed
   algorithm.},

Abstract = {The secure performance of wideband cognitive radio networks (CRNs) with
   OFDMA (orthogonal frequency-division multiple access) achieved by using
   physical layer security is low due to the severe channel fading and the
   limit transmit power of the secondary base station (SBS). To improve the
   secure performance, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted jamming
   wideband CRNs is studied where a UAV transmits the jamming signal to
   interfere with the eavesdropper (Eve) and the SBS provides communication
   services for the secondary users (SUs) over multiple sub-carrier
   channels. The total average secrecy rate of the secondary network is
   maximized by jointly optimizing the sub-carrier allocation, the jamming
   UAV trajectory, and the transmission power of the UAV and the SBS. An
   alternative algorithm is proposed to solve the challenging non-convex
   optimization problem. Simulation results verify the efficiency of our
   proposed algorithm and show that UAV-assisted jamming is beneficial for
   improving secure performance of wideband CRNs. It is also shown that our

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate a novel unmanned aerial vehicle

   system where one UAV moves around to communicate with multiple users on

   other UAV in the area jams the eavesdroppers on the ground to protect
   communications of the desired users. Specifically, we maximize the
   minimum worst-case secrecy rate among the users within each period by
   jointly adjusting UAV trajectories and user scheduling under the maximum
   UAV speed constraints, the UAV return constraints, the UAV collision
   avoidance constraints, and the discrete binary constraints on user
   scheduling variables. Since the resulting optimization problem is very
   difficult to solve due to its highly nonlinear objective function and
   nonconvex constraints, we first equivalently transform it into a more
   tractable problem. In particular, the binary constraints are
   equivalently converted to a number of equality constraints. Then, we
   develop a novel joint optimization algorithm to handle the converted

Abstract = {Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite Signal-of-Opportunity (SOP) positioning
   technology has gradually matured to meet the accuracy requirements for
   unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) positioning in daily scenarios.
   Advancements in miniaturization technology for positioning terminals
   have also made this technology's application to UAV positioning crucial
   for UAV development. However, in the increasingly complex
   electromagnetic environment, there remains a significant risk of
   degradation in positioning performance for UAVs in LEO satellite SOP
   positioning due to unintentional or malicious jamming. Furthermore,
   there is a lack of in-depth research from scholars both domestically and
   internationally on the anti-jamming capabilities of LEO satellite SOP
   positioning technology. Due to significant differences in the downlink
   signal characteristics between LEO satellites and Global Navigation
   Satellite System (GNSS) signals based on Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) or
   Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites, the anti-jamming research
   results of traditional satellite navigation systems cannot be directly
   applied. This study addresses the narrow bandwidth and high
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) characteristics of signals from LEO
   satellite constellations. We propose a Consecutive Iteration based on
   Signal Cancellation (SCCI) algorithm, which significantly reduces errors
   during the model fitting process. Additionally, an adaptive variable
   convergence factor was designed to simultaneously balance convergence
   speed and steady-state error during the iteration process. Compared to
   traditional algorithms, simulation and experimental results demonstrated
   that the proposed algorithm enhances the effectiveness of jamming
   threshold settings under narrow bandwidth and high-power conditions. In
   the context of LEO satellite jamming scenarios, it improves the
   frequency-domain anti-jamming performance significantly and holds high

Abstract = {This paper investigates the physical layer security issue in an unmanned

Title = {Robust 3D trajectory and power design in probabilistic LoS channel for
   UAV-enabled cooperative jamming},
Journal = {VEHICULAR COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a mobile unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled
   jamming scheme under the probabilistic line-of-sight (LoS) channel model
   to improve the secrecy of ground wiretap channels in urban areas, where
   a friendly UAV is deployed to cooperatively transmit jamming signals to
   confuse the suspicious ground eavesdroppers. Our goal is to maximize the
   average (expected) secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the user
   scheduling, the source's transmit power, the UAV's jamming power and its
   three-dimensional (3D) trajectory for a given flight time. Since the
   expected secrecy rate is highly complicated with respect to the 3D UAV
   trajectory, we derive a more tractable lower bound for it. Nevertheless,
   the resulting optimization problem is still non-convex and difficult to
   solve optimally due to the imperfect location information of the
   eavesdroppers. To tackle such an intractable problem, we first derive a
   worst-case (expected) secrecy rate, and then we propose an efficient
   iterative algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution to it by applying
   the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation
   (SCA) techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm
   under the probabilistic LoS channel model significantly outperforms
   various benchmark algorithms. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {High-performance positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) service is
   critical to the safe flight of low-altitude aircraft and the effective
   management of low altitude traffic. In low-altitude economic scenarios,
   the specificity of massive unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights and the
   complexity of low-altitude airspace traffic management impose stringent
   demand on the high-continuity, high-accuracy, real-time, and
   high-security PNT service. However, the current PNT service, which
   primarily relies on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS),
   Micro-Electro-Mechanical System Inertial Navigation System (MEMS INS),
   etc., is completely inadequate to support the future needs of
   low-altitude economic development. In order to bridge the huge gap
   between existing capability and future demand, a three-layer PNT
   architecture based on the collaboration of space-based, air-based and
   ground-based PNT systems is proposed for low-altitude economy. The
   space-based layer consists of high, medium even possible low orbit GNSS
   constellations, such as BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), for
   high-precision, high-security absolute positioning and timing. The
   air-based layer leverages inter-aircraft links for high-reliability
   dynamic relative positioning. The ground-based layer includes pseudolite
   network, as well as 5G-advanced (5G-A)/6G network, for more
   comprehensive coverage and real-time positioning. To this end, it is
   imperative to make breakthroughs in key technologies, from systems to
   airborne terminal, including but not limited to high-precision
   anti-jamming GNSS signal processing, high-reliability relative
   positioning, real-time pseudolite positioning, and high-efficient
   multi-source information fusion at airborne terminal, etc. Due to the
   moderate redundancy, heterogeneous mechanism, and multiple coverage from
   multiple PNT systems, the proposed layered PNT architecture possesses
   high robustness and resilient. Additionally, the integration of INS,
   LiDAR and vision etc. perception technologies can significantly enhance
   the PNT capability. As a result, the proposed three-layer PNT
   architecture enable greater autonomy for low-altitude aircraft and
   intelligent traffic management for massive UAV operations, and promoting
   the safe and efficient development of the low-altitude economy.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Covert unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication has garnered
   considerable attention in wireless systems for realizing the sustainable
   low-altitude economy (LAE). This paper investigates the system policy,
   trajectory design, and resource allocation for energy-efficient aerial
   networked systems with the aid of an integrated sensing and
   communications (ISAC) framework, in which multiple UAVs are employed to
   simultaneously conduct cooperative sensing and covert downlink
   transmissions to multiple ground users (GUs) in the presence of a mobile
   warden (Willie). Specifically, to improve the communication covertness,
   UAVs are strategically switched between jamming (JUAV) and information
   (IUAV) modes. Additionally, to cope with the mobility of Willie, an
   unscented Kalman filtering (UKF)-based method is employed to track and
   predict Willie's location relying on the delay and Doppler measurements
   extracted from the ISAC echoes. Capitalizing on the predicted Willie's
   location, a real-time energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is
   formulated by jointly optimizing the JUAV selection strategy, IUAV-GU
   scheduling, communication/jamming power allocation, and UAV trajectories
   design. The formulation takes into account the communication covertness
   requirement and the maximum transmit power budget, leading to a
   mixed-integer non-convex fractional programming. To tackle this
   challenge, the alternating optimization (AO) approach is adopted, which
   decomposes the original problem into a series of subproblems, allowing
   us to obtain an efficient sub-optimal solution. Simulation results
   demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of tracking Willie
   accurately and offering excellent system EE performance compared to
   various benchmark schemes adopting existing designs. (c) 2025 The

Abstract = {Altitude estimation is one of the fundamental tasks of unmanned aerial
   vehicle (UAV) automatic navigation, where it aims to accurately and
   robustly estimate the relative altitude between the UAV and specific
   areas. However, most methods rely on auxiliary signal reception or
   expensive equipment, which are not always available, or applicable owing
   to signal interference, cost or power-consuming limitations in real
   application scenarios. In addition, fixed-wing UAVs have more complex
   kinematic models than vertical take-off and landing UAVs. Therefore, an
   altitude estimation method which can be robustly applied in a GPS denied
   environment for fixed-wing UAVs must be considered. In this paper, we
   present a method for high-precision altitude estimation that combines
   the vision information from a monocular camera and poses information
   from the inertial measurement unit (IMU) through a novel end-to-end deep
   neural network architecture. Our method has numerous advantages over
   existing approaches. First, we utilize the visual-inertial information
   and physics-based reasoning to build an ideal altitude model that
   provides general applicability and data efficiency for neural network
   learning. A further advantage is that we have designed a novel feature
   fusion module to simplify the tedious manual calibration and
   synchronization of the camera and IMU, which are required for the
   standard visual or visual-inertial methods to obtain the data
   association for altitude estimation modeling. Finally, the proposed
   method was evaluated, and validated using real flight data obtained
   during a fixed-wing UAV landing phase. The results show the average
   estimation error of our method is less than 3\% of the actual altitude,
   which vastly improves the altitude estimation accuracy compared to other
   visual and visual-inertial based methods.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided jamming
   technique for enabling physical layer keyless security in scenarios
   where the exact eavesdropper location is unknown. We assume that the
   unknown eavesdropper location is within an ellipse characterizing the
   coverage region of the transmitter. By sequentially optimizing the
   transmit power, the flight path of the UAV and its jamming power, we aim
   at maximizing the average secrecy rate with arbitrary eavesdropper
   location. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal flight path
   obtains better secrecy rate performance compared to that using direct
   UAV flight path encasing the transmitter and the legitimate receiver.
   Most importantly, even with the unknown eavesdropper location, we
   obtained a secrecy rate that is comparable to a scenario when the
   eavesdropper \& x2019;s location is known. However, the average secrecy
   rate with the unknown eavesdropper location varies depending on the
   proximity of the eavesdropper to the known location of the transmitter.
   We also observe that due to the UAV-aided jamming, the average secrecy
   rate stabilizes at some point even though the average received envelope
   power of the eavesdropper increases. This essentially demonstrates the
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided augmented reality (AR) has developed
   rapidly in recent years and has become a promising technology in
   disaster rescue, transportation, agriculture, and environmental
   monitoring. However, the information leakage is challenging the usage of
   UAV-aided AR systems with wireless communications. In this article, a
   dual UAVs assisted covert communication system (CCS) is proposed, where
   one UAV transmits the covert message to ground receivers and a
   cooperative UAV performs as a jammer to interfere with the malicious
   eavesdropper. However, flying UAVs result in fast channel fading between
   the UAVs and ground nodes, which reduces the covert rate of the CCSs. To
   maximize the average covert rate, we formulated a non-convex
   optimization problem under the constraint that the detection error
   probability (DEP) of the monitor is minimum. Furthermore, the problem is
   decomposed into three subproblems and transformed into convex, and these
   subproblems are solved alternately by designing an iterative algorithm.
   Simulation results reveal that the average covert rate performance of

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in various fields,
   which mainly relies on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) to
   obtain position information. However, fast-moving jamming poses a big
   challenge for UAV navigation. This motivates us to develop new robust
   adaptive beamforming technique that is capable of enhancing the
   navigation signal and suppressing the jamming efficiently. Since the
   navigation signal and jamming present non-Gaussianity in statistics, the
   minimum dispersion distortionless response (MDDR) beamformer is
   utilized, which exhibits better performance of non-Gaussian signal
   reception over the minimum variance-based beamformer. To suppress the
   fast-moving jamming, the minimum power constraint is added to the
   optimization problem regarding to the MDDR beamformer, leading to a
   resultant problem with a quadratic constraint. Furthermore, instead of
   the quadratic constraint, a linear version is derived under the power
   constraint to achieve a shape null sector towards the fast-moving
   jamming, and as a consequence, a linearly constrained MDDR beamforming
   is established. This allows us to develop two algorithms, i.e.,
   quasi-MVDR algorithm and Newton's method, to accelerate the solution.
   Simulation results show that the proposed beamformer is able to suppress
   the fast-moving jamming efficiently for UAV navigation.},

Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {159},
Number = {C},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {In complex environments with uncertain communication interference,
   heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicle (HUAV) swarm often encounter the
   challenge of communication disruptions while collaboratively executing
   reconnaissance and coverage missions, hindering efficient information
   sharing and subsequently leading to substantial issues of redundant
   coverage. Given that existing research overlooks the impact of
   communication interference, this paper proposes a Coverage-Oriented
   Multi-Agent Cooperative Artificial Potential Field (MACAPF) algorithm.
   Firstly, a communication model for HUAV swarm under communication
   interference is considered to accurately reflect real-time communication
   status. Secondly, an autonomous collaborative distributed-concentrated
   architecture is devised, which dynamically adjusts the
   distributed-concentrated state of the swarm based on varying
   communication conditions, providing support for resolving communication
   disruptions faced by the HUAV swarm. Lastly, addressing the limitations
   of traditional artificial potential field (APF) algorithm in unknown
   communication interference environments, individualized definitions of
   the HUAV potential field are introduced, and the MACAPF algorithm is
   designed based on the autonomous collaborative distributed-concentrated
   architecture. This algorithm effectively guides HUAVs experiencing
   communication disruptions to restore communication, enhancing the
   communication efficiency and cooperative operation capabilities of the
   HUAV swarm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MACAPF
   algorithm exhibits significant advantages over other state of the art
   (SOTA) algorithms across multiple dimensions under various signal
   interference intensities.},

Title = {Trajectory Matters: Impact of Jamming Attacks Over the Drone Path
   Planning on the Internet of Drones},
Journal = {AD HOC NETWORKS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {146},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {The Internet of Drones (IoD) is a network paradigm where drones will fly
   over well-defined airways. The Jamming Attack (JA) poses a severe risk
   to IoD, affecting the drone's trajectory. Although JA has been
   investigated in UAV-based networks, the current solutions consider the
   airspace free to fly, whereas IoD allows drones to fly over constrained
   airspace, named airways. This study investigates the impact of JA over
   IoD, mainly regarding the drone path planning and, therefore, the drone
   trajectory. Also, we conduct a thorough discussion regarding the current
   challenges. To overcome these challenges, we propose the IoD-JAPM, an
   airway-aware protection mechanism against JA on the IoD, ranging from
   analyzing the airway's availability to the potential reformulation of
   the drone path planning. We perform an experimental evaluation through
   simulations to compare IoD-JAPM with a baseline solution and an existing
   approach that considers the airspace free to fly, varying the IoD
   topology and the number of jammers in the environment. We analyze four
   different metrics to measure at what level IoD-JAPM can mitigate a JA.
   Through the results, we observe a relation between the impact of JA on
   the drone path planning and the robustness of the topology, where the
   more restricted the topology, the more impact JA causes. Also, IoD-JAPM
   mitigates the effects of JA on path planning, causing few reformulations
   or even flight cancellations. Specifically, IoD-JAPM prevents all drones
   from being attacked when the environment has one jammer and mitigates
   the attack at 30\% for two jammers. Furthermore, IoD-JAPM overcomes the
   baseline study regarding the increasing drone flight distance, and power
   consumption. Since the drone propellers affect most of the drone
   battery, the more the flight distance the more the power consumption.
   Also, the results reinforce that ``free-to-fly{''}approaches cannot be
   applied in airway-oriented environments with strong jamming signals. In
   a nutshell, IoD-JAPM represents a robust protection mechanism against JA
   considering the aerial space defined through airways, advancing the
   state of the art of IoD-based protection mechanisms against JA.},

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) show significant potential in enhancing
   communication services within the mobile edge computing (MEC) system by
   taking their advantages on the flexible mobility and reliable
   line-of-sight links. However, in the scenarios with multiple UAV-MECs
   (UMs) operating concurrently, potential conflicts in their trajectories
   need to be mitigated. Thus, the 3-D trajectory needs to be properly
   designed in a highly reliable manner. Besides, such an
   infrastructure-free communication paradigm also exposes a potential risk
   of misuse by malicious parties, which allows them to eavesdrop on
   private communications, posing a threat to the security and privacy.
   Therefore, we consider a multi-UAV-assisted MEC communication system,
   where a UAV maliciously eavesdrops on the data transmission from the
   user devices (UDs) while a jammer is deployed on the ground to interfere
   with the eavesdropping channel. In specific, our objective is to
   minimize the energy consumption and latency while incorporating fairness
   metrics by optimizing the 3-D trajectories of UMs, transmission power of
   UDs, and the offloading strategies under the constraints of ensuring
   communication security and load fairness. Given the complexity of this
   mixed-integer nonconvex programming problem, we decompose the formulated
   problem into three subproblems. Specifically, at each time slot, we
   optimize the transmit power and offloading strategies using theoretical
   derivation and mathematical analysis, respectively. Additionally, a
   multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm is
   employed to optimize the trajectories of UMs. Simulation results
   demonstrate that our proposed joint optimization algorithm successfully
   minimizes the system energy consumption and delay as compared to
   benchmarking schemes.},

Abstract = {With more and more distributed deployment of Internet of Things (IoTs)
   in 5/6G networks, the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted
   much interest for mobile edge computing service outside the coverage of
   terrestrial cellular systems. However, due to the interference and
   coverage hole issues of UAV-assisted aerial 3D communications, how to
   design a suitable UAV trajectory is crucial for the performance of
   future 6G-UAV. In order to achieve a balance between the communication
   quality and mission accomplishment, we define an environmental model
   with random interference and formulate a trajectory optimization problem
   to improve the communication coverage performance in high mobility
   conditions. By setting an interference point in the highly dynamic
   networks, we propose a novel trajectory optimization algorithm based on
   deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to minimize the overall task execution
   delay and expected outage duration. The received data information of
   UAVs is used for double deep q-network (DDQN) training while the
   prioritized empirical replay architecture in the prioritized replay deep
   q network (DQN) is utilized to select the best UAV action, avoid the UAV
   flying into the random interference points, and reduce the random

Abstract = {The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are competent to perform a variety
   of applications, possessing great potential and promise. The deep neural
   networks (DNN) technology has enabled the UAV-assisted paradigm,
   accelerated the construction of smart cities, and propelled the
   development of the Internet of Things (IoT). UAVs play an increasingly
   important role in various applications, such as surveillance,
   environmental monitoring, emergency rescue, and supplies delivery, for
   which a robust path-planning technique is the foundation and
   prerequisite. However, existing methods lack comprehensive consideration
   of the complicated urban environment and do not provide an overall
   assessment of the robustness and generalization. Meanwhile, due to the
   resource constraints and hardware limitations of UAVs, the complexity of
   deploying the network needs to be reduced. This article proposes a
   lightweight, reinforcement-learning-based (RL-based) real-time
   path-planning method for UAVs, adaptive SAC (ASAC) algorithm, which
   optimizing the training process, network architecture, and algorithmic
   models. First of all, we establish a framework of global training and
   local adaptation, where the structured environment model is constructed
   for interaction, and local dynamically varying information aids in
   improving generalization. Second, ASAC introduces a cross-layer
   connection approach that passes the original state information into the
   higher layers to avoid feature loss and improve learning efficiency.
   Finally, we propose an adaptive temperature coefficient, which flexibly
   adjusts the exploration probability of UAVs with the training phase and
   experience data accumulation. In addition, a series of comparison
   experiments have been conducted in conjunction with practical
   application requirements, and the results have fully proved the
   favorable superiority of ASAC.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes a feature fusion algorithm for solving the path

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can serve as aerial base stations for
   users due to their flexibility, low cost, and other characteristics.
   However, due to the high flight position of UAVs, the air-to-ground
   (ATG) channels usually dominate with line-of-sight (LoS), which can be
   easily eavesdropped by multiple eavesdroppers. This poses a challenge to
   secure communication between UAVs and ground users. In this paper, we
   study a UAV-aided secure communication in an urban scenario where a
   legitimate UAV Alice transmits confidential information to a legitimate
   user Bob on the ground in the presence of several eavesdroppers around
   it and a UAV Jammer sends artificial noise to interfere with the
   eavesdroppers. We aim to maximize the physical layer secrecy rates in
   the system by jointly optimizing the trajectories of UAVs and their
   transmitting power. Considering the time-varying characteristics of
   channels, this problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). An
   improved algorithm based on double-DQN is proposed in the paper to solve
   this MDP problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm
   can converge quickly under different environments, and the UAV
   transmitter and UAV jammers can find the optimal location correctly to
   maximize the information secrecy rate. It also shows that the double-DQN
   (DDQN) based algorithm works better than the Q-learning and deep
   Q-learning network (DQN).},

Abstract = {The combination of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mobile edge
   computing (MEC) is considered as a promising approach to tackle soaring
   computing requirements. The broadcast nature of air-to-ground (A2G)
   links makes UAV communications vulnerable to eavesdroppers, so secure
   UAV communications remain an open question. This paper proposes a secure
   communication scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surface
   (RIS)-assisted UAV-MEC systems, in which the RIS assists the user in
   offloading data to the legitimate UAV, and the legitimate UAV provides
   computing services to the user. To fully expand the security computing
   capacity of the system, the communication link is improved by
   introducing RIS, and the jammer interferes with the eavesdropper. The
   secure computing capability of the system is maximized by optimizing
   communication resources and trajectories. Since the proposed problem is
   non-convex, successive convex approximation (SCA) technique and block
   coordinate descent (BCD) technique is combined to solve the problem. The
   simulation results show that the proposed scheme in this paper can
   effectively improve the system secure computing bits compared with the

   This paper investigates the RIS-assisted UAV-MEC uplink secure

Abstract = {With the inherent advantages of exceptional maneuverability, flexible
   deployment options and cost-effectiveness, unmanned aerial vehicles
   (UAVs) present themselves as a viable solution for providing aerial
   communication services to Internet of Things devices in high-traffic or
   remote areas. Nevertheless, the openness of the air-ground channel poses
   significant security challenges to UAV-based wireless systems. In this
   paper, a UAV-assisted secure communication system model is established
   based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) from the perspective of
   physical layer security, aiming to conceal the transmission behavior
   between UAVs and legitimate users (LUs). Specifically, a mobile UAV
   assumes the role of an aerial base station, leveraging NOMA technique to
   transmit data to LUs while evading detection from mobile eavesdropper
   situated on the ground. To fortify the security performance of the
   system, a hovering UAV acts as a friendly jammer and transmits
   interference signals to mobile eavesdropper (referred to as Eve). The
   objective of this scheme is to maximize the minimum average secure rate
   of all LUs by meticulously optimizing the trajectory and power
   allocation of the mobile UAV, subject to secrecy performance
   constraints. The highly interdependent and non-convex nature of this
   optimization problem renders direct solutions infeasible. Hence, this
   paper designs an efficient iterative algorithm that decouples the
   original problem into two subproblems, enabling an alternating
   optimization process for the trajectory and power allocation of the
   mobile UAV until the convergence of the objective function is achieved.
   Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively
   improves the minimum average secure rate of all LUs compared with the

Abstract = {The application of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in complex
   urban environments has demonstrated significant potential for emergency

   However, path planning for multi-UAV systems in such environments
   remains particularly challenging due to the presence of various threat
   zones, including obstacles, signal interference regions, and hazardous
   areas, which existing methods fail to address adequately. We present an
   enhanced grid-based modeling approach specifically designed for urban
   environments with distinct threat zones to bridge this gap. In addition,
   we propose an improved Multi-UAV Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star
   (RRT{*}) algorithm integrated with Biased Sampling, Candidate Evaluation
   and Path Reconfiguration techniques (MU-RRT{*}-BCR). Specifically, the
   combination of biased sampling and candidate evaluation enhances node
   selection, reducing the average objective function value by 16.66\% and
   CPU time by 80.28\% compared to MU-RRT{*}. Additionally, a security
   detection mechanism is incorporated to prevent inter-UAV collisions.
   Moreover, a path reconfiguration technique is employed to refine the UAV
   trajectories, while the Dubins method is applied to ensure that the
   planned paths satisfy UAV kinematic constraints. Overall, extensive

   reduces the average objective function value by 17.59\% and CPU time by
   81.26\% while achieving 4.86\% and 65.91\% reductions, respectively,

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a feature-density based path planning

   challenging scenarios like dense forests, urban canyons, or underground
   areas where visual landmarks may be sparse, our method dynamically
   adjusts the drone's trajectory to maximize the traversal of visually
   rich areas. By utilizing DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of

   feature density and abundant visual information, so that include them
   into the planned route. The outlier removal techniques are used to avoid
   inefficient detours that do not contribute to visual-based navigation,
   further optimizing the path. A weighted vector summation strategy is
   applied to balance between the shortest RTH route and maximizing the use
   of these high-density feature regions to enhance localization accuracy.
   Through simulation in environments with varying feature densities, our

Abstract = {A wide range of research has been conducted on path planning and

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have shown significant advantages in

   significantly limits communication performance. Additionally, the
   openness of the wireless channel poses a serious threat, such as
   wiretapping and jamming. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the
   security performance of the system. Recently, Reconfigurable Intelligent

   signal while suppressing the eavesdropping signal. This paper
   investigates a RIS-assisted Cognitive UAV Network with multiple
   corresponding receiving users as cognitive users (CUs) in the presence
   of malicious eavesdroppers (Eav), in which the Cognitive UAV functions
   as the mobile aerial Base Station (BS) to transmit confidential messages
   for the users on the ground. Our primary aim is to attain the maximum
   secrecy bits by means of jointly optimizing the transmit power, access
   scheme of the CUs, the RIS phase shift matrix, and the trajectory. In
   light of the fact that the access scheme is an integer, the original
   problem proves to be a mixed integer non-convex one, which falls into
   the NP-hard category. To solve this problem, we propose block coordinate
   descent and successive convex approximation (BCD-SCA) algorithms.
   Firstly, we introduce the BCD algorithm to decouple the coupled
   variables and convert the original problem into four sub-problems for
   the non-convex subproblems to solve by the SCA algorithm. The results of
   our simulations indicate that the joint optimization scheme we have put
   forward not only achieves robust convergence but also outperforms
   conventional benchmark approaches.},

Abstract = {We consider a type of routing problems common in defence and security,
   in which we control a fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that have
   to reach one or more target locations without being detected by an
   adversary. Detection can be carried out by a variety of sensors (radio
   receivers, cameras, personnel, etc) placed by the adversary around the
   target sites. We model the act of detecting a UAV from first principles
   by noting that sensors work by monitoring frequencies in the
   electromagnetic spectrum for signals or noise emitted. By this, we are
   able to provide a flexible and versatile nonlinear optimisation
   framework in which the problem is modeled as a novel trajectory
   optimisation problem with paths of the UAVs as continuous arcs in an
   Euclidean space. The flexibility of our approach is exhibited by the
   fact that we can easily consider various relevant objectives, among them
   minimising the overall probability of detection and maximising the
   location error that the adversary experiences when trying to locate our
   UAVs. Our model is also versatile enough to consider the act of jamming,
   in which one or more of our UAVs intentionally send out signals to
   interfere with the operations of the adversary's sensors. Numerical
   results show the flexibility of our framework, and that we can solve
   realistic instances of this problem type.},

   Using Deep Reinforcement Learning and Particle Swarm Optimization},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 NOV 19},
Abstract = {Efficient management of limited resources, reduced data transmission
   latency, and improved overall network performance are critical in ground
   networks. This paper proposes a hierarchical sensing and offloading
   framework for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), where unmanned
   aerial vehicles (UAVs) act as mobile data aggregators to support ITS
   monitoring in areas beyond roadside unit (RSU) coverage, during RSU
   outages, or under severe ground network congestion. By enabling
   localized offloading, the framework ensures the timely delivery of
   critical ITS data. The proposed secrecy-aware approach enhances the
   resilience, efficiency, and integrity of ITS sensing and communications.
   Although UAVs offer advantages such as high mobility, on-demand
   deployment, and reliance on line-of-sight (LoS) communication channels,
   they remain vulnerable to security threats. To counter eavesdropping and
   jamming threats, the proposed method combines policy-gradient
   reinforcement learning with protective jamming and secrecy-aware
   transmission scheduling, enabling UAVs to adaptively adjust flight
   paths, transmit power, and time slot assignments. A multi-objective
   reward function is designed to jointly optimize secrecy rate,
   communication delay, and energy consumption under adversarial
   conditions. Extensive simulations confirm the proposed model's
   effectiveness in enhancing communication security and operational
   efficiency across varying threat scenarios.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate jamming-resilient UAV path planning
   strategies for data collection in Internet of Things (IoT) networks, in
   which the typical UAV can learn the optimal trajectory to elude such
   jamming attacks. Specifically, the typical UAV is required to collect
   data from multiple distributed IoT nodes under collision avoidance,
   mission completion deadline, and kinematic constraints in the presence
   of jamming attacks. We first design a fixed ground jammer with
   continuous jamming attack and periodical jamming attack strategies to
   jam the link between the typical UAV and IoT nodes. Defensive strategies
   involving a reinforcement learning (RL) based virtual jammer and the
   adoption of higher SINR thresholds are proposed to counteract against
   such attacks. Secondly, we design an intelligent UAV jammer, which
   utilizes the RL algorithm to choose actions based on its observation.
   Then, an intelligent UAV anti-jamming strategy is constructed to deal
   with such attacks, and the optimal trajectory of the typical UAV is
   obtained via dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN). Simulation results
   show that both non-intelligent and intelligent jamming attacks have
   significant influence on the UAV's performance, and the proposed defense
   strategies can recover the performance close to that in no-jammer

Abstract = {With the widespread application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), the
   issue of path planning has become increasingly significant in search of
   suitable paths for UAVs. However, positioning errors may exist in the
   system carried by the UAV in practical situations, leading to the
   suboptimal or even unsafe path execution. In view of this, we construct
   the multi-UAV robust path planning model under position uncertainty by
   incorporating several important considerations. This can be expressed as
   a complicated robust optimization problem, aiming to obtain a robust
   optimal path for each UAV in the presence of positioning errors. Based
   on this, we introduce the corresponding overall cost function and its
   expected expression for robust evaluation. Then, we propose a novel
   robust particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, which employs the
   scale-free topology to characterize the individual interactions in the
   swarm. And an improved explicit sampling technique is developed by
   introducing a sampling coefficient, where the number of samples
   increases proportional to the degree value for a particle in PSO,
   allowing effective robustness evaluation for each solution. The proposed
   algorithm shows great advantages on benchmark functions, compared with
   some other robust PSO algorithms. Further, we present the specific
   implementation of the multi-UAV robust path planning method based on the
   proposed algorithm. Finally, simulation experiments on various path
   planning scenarios and comparison results indicate the superiority of
   the developed method, which can plan a robust and effective path for
   each UAV.},

Abstract = {Combining Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (AAVs) with public transportation

Abstract = {In event or disaster scenarios where network communication is jammed, it

   reasonable amount of time. We propose a path planning algorithm for
   unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to serve network traffic in hotspot

   services to users, while preparing for future hotspots. We propose a
   simple yet efficient trajectory design consisting of two phases: 1)
   targeting traffic for a single UAV, and 2) cooperative targeting for
   multiple UAVs. First, each UAV selects a long-term target considering
   future traffic and then a short-term target considering the present
   traffic. When UAVs encounter other UAVs, a cooperative targeting phase
   ensures UAVs serve traffic in different locations or with different
   statuses. Our trajectory design enables a UAV to construct its own path
   for a continuous UAV-enabled network. Simulation and real-world
   dataset-based experiments confirmed that our targeting scheme provides
   sufficient network service in a reasonable time, with an average service

Abstract = {Thanks to their quick placement and high flexibility, unmanned aerial

   The system includes a suspicious transmission link with a terrestrial

   suspicious link. The UAV can adjust its positions and send jamming
   signal to the suspicious receiver to ensure successful eavesdropping.
   Based on this model, we first develop an approach to minimize the

   (re-)formulation, an alternating optimization approach is developed to
   compute a locally optimal solution in polynomial time. Furthermore, we

Abstract = {Accurate spatial distribution information of field features is critical

   Experimental validation demonstrates a 5.9\% accuracy improvement over
   RandLA-Net on the Semantic3D benchmark. This advancement significantly
   enhances perception accuracy in complex agricultural environments,

Abstract = {In recent years, drones have been used to assist delivering small goods
   as a solution to traffic jams and air pollutions to serve the purpose of
   effective and sustainable delivery. Thus, a green truck-drone
   collaborative delivery routing problem with multiple drops is studied in
   this paper. A multi-objective truck-drone route planning model
   considering carbon emissions and traveling time is developed. Compared
   to most of the existing research in which drones can deliver only one
   node per trip, this study extends the model to a more complicated
   realistic situation that drones deliver multiple drops per trip. A
   NSGA-II algorithm is designed to address the above-described problem.
   Then, cases with clustered, semi-clustered and randomly distributed
   customers are analyzed to find out the influence of customer
   distribution characteristics on the environmental performance and time
   efficiency. As numerical experiment results show, the improved
   collaborative delivery model significantly reduces carbon emissions and
   improves delivery efficiency, especially when customers are randomly
   distributed or semi-clustered. Finally, the optimal traveling speed
   range is obtained through the speed sensitivity analysis, which provide
   a sustainable decision-making basis for daily operations.},

   vehicles (UAVs) is a promising topic but the relevant research is tepid.
   This article aims at exploring this problem for multistatic
   radar-enabled UAVs (RUAVs) via a multiagent cooperative sensing and
   control scheme, in which all RUAVs constitute a multistatic radar system
   with variable and movable transmitting and receiving platforms, and each
   RUAV as an autonomous agent makes decision with other agents for
   transmit-receive task assignment and path planning to seek the optimal
   overall target tracking performance. The optimization problem of RUAVs
   is formulated as minimizing the Bayesian Cram \& eacute;r-Rao lower
   bound with some practical constraints. To solve this problem, an
   alternating iterative optimization scheme is presented, in which the
   coalition formation method is applied for transmit-receive task
   assignment and the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is
   devised for path planning. The alternating coalition formation and PSO
   (ACFPSO) algorithm is, therefore, proposed for RUAVs for target tracking
   in stand-forward jamming. Numerical simulations in the typical scenario
   are conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the ACFPSO
   algorithm from aspects of tracking accuracy and jamming elimination.},

Title = {A Jamming Aware Artificial Potential Field Method to Counter GPS Jamming

Abstract = {Global positioning system (GPS) plays an important role in the path
   planning of unmanned surface ships. As we know, the civil GPS signal is
   not encrypted, and its structure is open. Meanwhile, the power strength
   of GPS signals arriving at receivers is weak. All of these make GPS
   vulnerable to jamming. GPS jamming attacks adversely affect the accuracy
   of the received GPS signals, thus affecting the path planning results of
   unmanned surface ships and even causing collisions. This article
   presents a jamming aware artificial potential field (JA-APF) method. The
   JA-APF method first determines whether GPS jamming exists in unmanned
   surface ships' surrounding environment by detecting the receivers'
   received signal strength and calculating the packet error rate. Then,
   the JA-APF method calculates the position range of the jamming source.
   Finally, the JA-APF method replans the path according to the resultant
   force of the attraction around the goal, the repulsion around obstacles,
   and the repulsion around multiple GPS jammers. Through the simulation,
   we determine the value of the repulsive potential factor of the jammer
   to optimize the path planning results of the JA-APF method and analyze
   the influence of the jamming power on the path planning results. The
   simulation results show that the JA-APF method can effectively solve the
   impact of GPS jamming on the results in the path planning process and
   recover as soon as possible.},

   Path Planning and Jamming Power Allocation Approach},
Journal = {IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {1640-1644},
Abstract = {This letter investigates the jammer path planning and jamming power
   allocation problem during airborne deterrence operation (ADO) in highly
   dynamic environments. In response to airborne threats posed by enemy
   aircraft formations, jammers must rely on perceptual information to plan
   trajectories and emit jamming signals to paralyze the ground-to-air
   (G2A) communication networks. Unlike traditional static scenarios, the
   high mobility of both sides presents significant challenges. Most works
   only study jamming solutions for static ground or single airborne
   targets, failing to address multiple airborne targets. We propose a
   joint path planning and jamming power allocation approach based on deep
   reinforcement learning (JPPJPA-DRL). This approach considers the impact
   of flight paths on receiving antenna gain, models the ADO as a Markov
   Decision Process (MDP), and uses the proximal policy optimization (PPO)
   algorithm to generate optimized path points and jamming power allocation
   schemes. In addition, a scientific reward function is designed to guide
   the learning process, and a visual communication countermeasure
   simulation platform is developed. The results show that the proposed
   approach can efficiently paralyze G2A communication networks,

Abstract = {Space-air-aqua integrated network (SAAIN) is an emerging maritime

   Considering the computation capability and information security in
   maritime transportation systems, this work proposes a double-edge secure
   offloading scheme, where both base-station (BS) and satellites provide
   secure mobile-edge computing services for delay-sensitive applications.
   Specifically, maritime mobile users may offload their computation tasks
   adaptively to the BS or satellites securely relayed by unmanned aerial
   vehicles (UAVs). To minimize offloading delay, we formulate an
   optimization problem to allocate the transmit power cooperatively via
   UAVs' trajectory optimization. Moreover, jamming UAVs are deployed to
   protect the offloading process. For such a nonconvex optimization
   problem, two iterative algorithms are proposed to determine the transmit
   power and design the UAVs' trajectories. Numerical results show the
   effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of offloading delay.},

Title = {An optimization-based selection approach of landing sites for swarm
   unmanned aerial vehicles in unknown environments},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {204},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Autonomous selection of landing sites is an important capability of a
   mission when unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) face technical difficulties
   or adverse weather, especially in unknown environments. In order to
   build a better decision-making system for swarm UAVs landing, besides
   terrain safety, the global flight cost among individuals should be also
   considered during descent. However, the existing methods cannot solve
   these problems elegantly due to terrain uncertainty and optimization
   complexity. In this paper, we present an optimization method to tackle
   this issue based on point cloud integrating the coarse-to-fine manner
   and swarm intelligence model. Specifically, our method starts with a
   point cloud preprocessing module for sparse elevation estimation and
   robust path planning. In the coarse stage, a novel cost map is
   constructed by extracting only low-level features from the elevation
   map. Based on the optimum results of the coarse selection, the final
   landing sites are automatically generated and finely evaluated in terms
   of multiple 3D terrain factors. Finally, the landing model of swarm-UAVs
   is treated as an unbalanced assignment problem, which minimizes flight
   costs by incorporating terrain safety, fuel consumption, and path
   planning. Experimental evaluations on three different realworld scenario
   datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both normal
   operations and emergency situations.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In precision agriculture, autonomous ground and aerial vehicles can lead
   to favourable improvements in field operations, extending crop scouting
   to large fields and performing field tasks in a timely and effective
   way. However, automated navigation and operations within a complex
   scenarios require specific and robust path planning and navigation
   control. Thus, in addition to proper knowledge of their instantaneous
   position, robotic vehicles and machines require an accurate spatial
   description of their environment. An innovative modelling framework is
   presented to semantically interpret 3D point clouds of vineyards and to
   generate low complexity 3D mesh models of vine rows. The proposed
   methodology, based on a combination of convex hull filtration and
   minimum area c-gon design, reduces the amount of instances required to
   describe the spatial layout and shape of vine canopies allowing the
   amount of data to be reduced without losing relevant crop shape
   information. The algorithm is not hindered by complex scenarios, such as
   nonlinear vine rows, as it is able to automatically process non uniform
   vineyards. Results demonstrated a data reduction of about 98\%; from the
   500 Mb ha(-1) required to store the original dataset to 7.6 Mb ha(-1)
   for the low complexity 3D mesh. Reducing the amount of data is crucial
   to reducing computational times for large original datasets, thus
   enabling the exploitation of 3D point cloud information in real-time
   during field operations. When considering scenarios involving
   cooperating machines and robots, data reduction will allow rapid
   communication and data exchange between in field actors. (C) 2020 The

Abstract = {Given a cooperative mission consisting of multiple tasks spatially
   distributed, an aerial robotic swarm's decision-making issues include
   team formation, team-to-task assignment, agent-to-work-position
   assignment and trajectory optimisation with collision avoidance. The
   problem becomes even more complicated when involving heterogeneous
   agents, tasks' minimum requirements and fair allocation. This paper
   formulates all the combined issues as an optimisation problem and then
   proposes an integrated framework that addresses the problem in a
   decentralised fashion. We approximate and decouple the complex original
   problem into three subproblems (i.e. coalition formation, position
   allocation and path planning), which are sequentially addressed by three
   different proposed modules. The coalition formation module based on game
   theories deals with a max-min problem, the objective of which is to
   partition the agents into disjoint task-specific teams in a way that
   balances the agents' work resources in proportion to the task's minimum
   workload requirements. For agents assigned to the same task, given
   reasonable assumptions, the position allocation subproblem can be
   efficiently addressed in terms of computational complexity. For the
   trajectory optimisation, we utilise a Model Predictive Control and
   Sequential Convex Programming algorithm, which reduces the size of the
   problem so that the agents can generate collision-free trajectories on a
   real-time basis. As a proof of concept, we implement the framework into
   an unmanned aerial vehicle swarm's cooperative stand-in jamming mission
   scenario and show its feasibility, fault tolerance and near-optimality
   based on numerical experiment.},

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized various industries

   employed to extract robust image features and generate a disparity map.
   Subsequently, a custom network processes and convolves these data,
   employing diverse computer vision techniques to achieve precise height
   estimation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we
   collected a comprehensive dataset by conducting flights with a Phantom 4
   Pro drone over the NUST Main campus, H-12 Islamabad. The dataset
   encompasses images captured at 10 different heights, spanning from 100
   to 280 m, with flights evenly spaced 20 m apart. In rigorous

Pages = {14686-14701},
Abstract = {With the widespread application of UAV technology, various countries are
   facing new threats in both military and civilian domains. To effectively
   counter these threats, UAV communication jamming has become a reliable
   countermeasure. Traditional communication jamming methods face several
   challenges. These include low efficiency, difficulties in managing
   dynamic and complex electromagnetic environments, and a heavy reliance
   on prior knowledge about the signals. This study presents intelligent
   jamming techniques for UAV signal processing to overcome the limitations
   found in current communication jamming technologies. The aim is to
   achieve precise jamming of individual target signals using intelligent
   jamming methods. This paper introduces an enhanced jamming signal
   generation algorithm built on the traditional convolutional autoencoder.
   Without relying on prior signal knowledge, the algorithm introduces
   complex convolutional networks and residual modules. The model leverages
   advanced convolutional networks to integrate the real and imaginary
   components of the signal for feature extraction, while the residual
   modules further refine signal processing and enhance feature learning.
   The model generates jamming signals by altering hidden layer features.
   These signals closely resemble the original communication waveforms.
   Simulation results show that, across different communication systems,
   the generated jamming signal waveforms exhibit strong similarity to the
   original signal waveforms. Moreover, under various
   signal-to-interference ratios (SIR), the jamming performance of the
   generated signals surpasses that of conventional jamming signals such as
   Gaussian noise and amplitude modulation noise.},

Pages = {68351-68369},
Abstract = {This research addresses the challenge in capturing rogue uncrewed aerial
   vehicle (UAV) strategies based on communication and navigation jamming
   technology in the absence of observable UAV communication performance
   parameters. The jamming involves remote communication suppressing (RCS)
   power control, as well as navigation suppressing (NS) and navigation
   deception (ND) combination, hence named as the diverse Hybrid jamming
   (DHJ) strategy. Firstly, we construct the DHJ model, which analyzes the
   dynamic impact mechanism of DHJ on UAV flight control systems based on
   common control protocols. Subsequently, we introduce the concept of the
   Situation Estimation Ring (SER) to overcome reward-driven deficiencies
   arising from incomplete observation and optimize features of the state
   space, which essentially considers the flight status feedback mechanism
   of the UAV to DHJ attacks and will be used to construct the DHJ Markov
   Decision Process (DHJ-MDP) mathematical framework. Then, the DHJ attack
   process against UAV is formulated as a game framework, where the
   counter-UAV system (CUS) generates DHJ strategy solely based on spatial
   positional states to deceive and capture the UAV, and the UAV adopts
   flight control strategies to evade jamming based on communication
   quality and navigation positioning information. Finally, the analysis of
   Nash equilibrium (NE) properties explain that the SER-based dynamic
   spatial positioning of UAV can be used for CUS to derive DHJ equilibrium
   strategies, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for solving these
   strategies using knowledge-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
   algorithms, with the algorithm's complexity also being proven.
   Simulation and comparison experiments demonstrate that the solved DHJ
   strategy effectively drives UAV toward deceptive destinations under
   incomplete observation states, achieve the `lure the enemy in deep'
   effect and the proposed SER-base algorithms enhances algorithm's
   convergence speed.},

Abstract = {Ensuring the resilient navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
   under conditions of limited or unstable sensor information is one of the
   key challenges of modern autonomous mobility within smart infrastructure
   and sustainable development. This article proposes an intelligent
   autonomous UAV control method based on the integration of geometric
   trajectory modeling, neural network-based sensor data filtering, and
   reinforcement learning. The geometric model, constructed using path
   coordinates, allows the trajectory tracking problem to be formalized as
   an affine control system, which ensures motion stability even in cases
   of partial data loss. To process noisy or fragmented GPS and IMU
   signals, an LSTM-based recurrent neural network filter is implemented.
   This significantly reduces positioning errors and maintains trajectory
   stability under environmental disturbances. In addition, the navigation
   system includes a reinforcement learning module that performs real-time
   obstacle prediction, path correction, and speed adaptation. The method
   has been tested in a simulated environment with limited sensor
   availability, variable velocity profiles, and dynamic obstacles. The
   results confirm the functionality and effectiveness of the proposed
   navigation system under sensor-deficient conditions. The approach is
   applicable to environmental monitoring, autonomous delivery, precision
   agriculture, and emergency response missions within smart regions. Its
   implementation contributes to achieving the Sustainable Development
   Goals (SDG 9, SDG 11, and SDG 13) by enhancing autonomy, energy

Abstract = {Traditional radio frequency (RF)-based anti-drone technologies focus on
   jamming the command and control (C2) RF signal or global navigation
   satellite system (GNSS) signal of a target drone. Although these methods
   efficiently neutralize target drones, they may generate unintended RF
   collisions with other equipment and cause the drone to crash. We
   introduce a method for hijacking a frequency hopping spread spectrum
   (FHSS)-based drone through C2 signal emission for takeover and a
   precision spoofing signal to invalidate the owner's transmitter signal
   using a multi-modem in this work. The proposed method simultaneously
   transmits C2 signals to the target drone for safe takeover and precision
   spoofing signals to neutralize the owner's transmitter, thereby
   minimizing RF collisions with other equipment.},

Abstract = {A multitude of applications based on unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs),
   in conjunction with the UAVs' diminishing costs and increasing
   capabilities, present a major threat to public safety as well as
   critical infrastructure security, leading to the need for versatile and

   jamming system, where a group of cooperative autonomous agents employ
   various algorithms (detection, tracking, jamming, and self-localization)
   to counter unauthorized drone operations. The proposed system employs a
   joint wireless jamming and cooperative positioning framework to best
   track and intercept the moving rogue drone, utilizing a relative
   positioning system based on signals of opportunity in conjunction with
   inertial and vision measurements. Software-defined radio technology is
   incorporated on the pursuer agent to achieve rogue drone GPS disruption,
   while at the same time the autonomous agents cooperate to compute the
   location estimate of the pursuer agent. In the presence of jamming, to
   improve the wireless communication performance of the autonomous agents,
   a cellular communication architecture is also used as an additional
   channel for control and information exchange. For evaluation purposes, a

Volume = {61},

Month = {JUL 24},
Abstract = {A general challenge in drone localisation and navigation is the strong
   dependence on satellite positioning. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
   (RIS) offer a promising technology for global navigation satellite
   system (GNSS)-free drone localisation and for the alleviation of the
   jammer effect by nulling the jamming signal. In this letter, we
   investigate how to optimise the nullification of the jammer while
   maximising the desired signal in a double RIS-aided GNSS-free drone
   localisation setup. The main objectives of the presented procedure are
   the maximisation of the desired signal received by the drone,
   minimisation of the jamming signal effect, accurate estimation of the
   angle of departure (AOD) from RIS to drone, and drone positioning in 3D.
   To address this challenge, we propose an alternating projection
   algorithm to perform jamming nullification by optimising the phase shift
   at each RIS element. Simulations show that by proper RIS element phase
   optimisation, the effect of the jammer is efficiently reduced, the AODs
   from RIS surfaces to drone are computed more accurately, and the drone

Volume = {194},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The rise of unlawful and unauthorized operations of unmanned aerial
   vehicles (UAVs) has led to the need for versatile counter-drone systems.
   In this work, an autonomous counter-drone system is developed (denoted
   as RPS-JS-DNN - relative positioning and simultaneous jamming system
   with deep neural network learning), where a pursuer drone employs
   algorithms for detection, tracking, and jamming a rogue drone in
   real-time. The proposed system incorporates wireless interception
   capabilities to jam the rogue drone, together with self-positioning for
   the pursuer drone by employing a relative positioning system methodology
   based on signals of opportunity fused with inertial measurements. The
   performance of the proposed system depends on the switching between the
   jamming and self-localization modules, essentially leading to a jamming
   duration and positioning accuracy trade-off. The overall objective is
   the maximization of the jamming module's operation time, while also
   increasing the performance of the self-localization module. In the
   proposed system, a software-defined radio (SDR) is utilized,
   facilitating jamming and spectrum sweeping capabilities to realize the
   desired GPS disturbance and self-localization, respectively. A prototype
   system is developed, implemented, deployed, and tested over extensive

Title = {A Robust Multi-Domain Adaptive Anti-Jamming Communication System for a
   UAV Swarm in Urban ITS Traffic Monitoring via Multi-Agent Deep
   Deterministic Policy Gradient},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUL 18},
Abstract = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) hold a central position in
   urban traffic strategies. Reliable and timely communication is crucial
   for the effective operation of ITS, because it requires uninterrupted
   real-time data to ensure safe and efficient traffic flow. As an
   indispensable component of ITS, Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer
   the agility, rapid deployment, and wide area vantage required for
   city-scale monitoring and prompt incident response. However, the crowded
   urban spectrum-characterized by co-channel interference, malicious
   jamming, and stringent spectrum and energy constraints-compromises the
   reliability and timeliness of UAV communications. This study
   investigates the anti-jamming communication problem for a UAV swarm
   applied to urban traffic monitoring and models this task as a
   decentralized, partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP).
   Based on this model, we develop a multi-domain adaptive scheme based on
   the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) framework.
   The combination of centralized training and decentralized execution
   enables each UAV to optimize channel selection and power control
   policies based on local observations, while a shared global reward
   encourages swarm-level cooperation. Extensive simulations show that,
   compared with baseline methods, the proposed method significantly
   improves link reliability, reduces power consumption, and lowers the
   overhead associated with frequent channel switching. Simulation results
   show that the proposed robust, energy-efficient communication strategy
   effectively improves the overall performance of the ITS urban traffic
   monitoring UAV swarm system.},

Abstract = {Precise navigation signals are essential for unmanned aerial vehicles
   (UAVs) to achieve accurate positioning and task execution. However,
   global positioning system (GPS) signals are highly vulnerable to
   spoofing and jamming attacks, posing serious threats to flight safety.
   Therefore, this article proposes an intelligent detection algorithm
   based on federated learning (FL) for identifying spoofing and jamming
   signals in UAV navigation. First, the algorithm innovatively integrates
   the local feature extraction ability of the temporal convolutional
   network (TCN) and the global dependency modeling advantage of the
   Transformer network, constructing a TCN-Transformer model to capture the
   features of navigation data efficiently. Second, a distributed
   construction network is adopted, where weight aggregation and updates
   are performed via FL, enabling global optimization without data sharing.
   Furthermore, an accuracy-weighted aggregation strategy is introduced,
   dynamically assigning weights based on the detection performance of each
   client mode. This encourages contributions of high-quality data and
   computational resources, thereby enhancing the overall model
   performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
   outperforms traditional algorithms in detecting navigation spoofing and
   jamming, offering superior detection accuracy and robustness.},

Title = {Trusted Multisource Fusion Navigation for UAV Under GNSS Interference
   and Spoofing Attacks},
Journal = {IEEE-ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS},
Year = {2025},
Month = {2025 JUN 4},
Abstract = {Trusted navigation is paramount for the safe operation and mission
   success of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complex environments.
   However, individual navigation systems possess inherent limitations. For
   example, global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) are vulnerable to
   signal denial, spoofing, and jamming attacks, whereas inertial
   navigation systems suffer from cumulative error growth that ultimately
   degrades navigation accuracy. To overcome these challenges, this article
   proposes a novel multisource fusion navigation framework tailored for
   UAVs operating under adverse conditions. First, we introduce a
   mechanical antenna (MA)-based positioning method as a complementary
   solution to GNSS unavailable. The MA, mounted on the UAV, transmits
   low-frequency magnetic field signals captured by ground-based magnetic
   sensors; subsequently, a particle swarm optimization algorithm is
   employed for MA positioning. Recognizing that near-field magnetic
   interference adversely affects MA accuracy, we further integrate an
   anomaly detection mechanism with dynamic adaptive fusion and federated
   filtering algorithms, respectively, to isolate data from compromised
   sensors. Comprehensive experimental evaluations, including UAV flights
   under GNSS spoofing attacks, demonstrate that the proposed fusion
   approach not only effectively detects various sensor attacks (achieving
   average accuracy and precision of 99.7\% and 98.7\%, respectively), but
   also maintains trusted navigation in GNSS-challenged and magnetically
   interfered environments.},

Title = {Covert communication towards a flying warden in UAV-assisted MEC system},
Journal = {CHINESE JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {38},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Due to the high flexibility of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs),
   equipping Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers on UAVs can effectively
   and rapidly handle the high computing requirements of
   computation-intensive tasks. However, the Line-of-Sight (LoS)
   transmission between the UAV and ground users makes the offloading
   information be easily monitored. Therefore, this paper proposes a covert
   communication scheme against a flying warden in UAV-assisted MEC system.
   In the proposed scheme, the UAV server assists ground users in
   completing the computation of offloading tasks. To reduce the
   possibility of the flying warden detecting the transmission behavior of
   ground users to the UAV server, a ground jamming device sends jamming
   signals to the flying warden. The minimum computing capacity of the
   system is maximized by jointly optimizing ground users' resources and
   the UAV server's trajectory under the constraint of system covertness.
   Due to the multivariable coupling, the optimization problem is
   non-convex. The optimization problem is first transformed into a
   tractable form, and then the optimizing solution is iteratively obtained
   using Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) and Block Coordinate Descent
   (BCD) algorithms. Numerical results show that, compared to the benchmark
   schemes, the proposed scheme effectively enhances the computing capacity
   of the system while meeting the system's covertness requirements. (c)

Abstract = {Today, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are heavily dependent on Global

   However, GNSS signals are vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks.
   This poses serious security risks, especially for military operations

   visual features were determined between satellite and UAV images and
   matching operations were carried out using methods based on the
   homography matrix. Thanks to image processing, a significant
   relationship has been established between the area where the UAV is
   located and the geographical coordinates, and reliable positioning is
   ensured even in cases where GNSS signals cannot be used. Within the
   scope of the study, traditional methods such as SIFT, AKAZE, and

Abstract = {Introduction Accurate vehicle analysis from aerial imagery has become
   increasingly vital for emerging technologies and public service
   applications such as intelligent traffic management, urban planning,
   autonomous navigation, and military surveillance. However, analyzing
   UAV-captured video poses several inherent challenges, such as the small
   size of target vehicles, occlusions, cluttered urban backgrounds, motion
   blur, and fluctuating lighting conditions which hinder the accuracy and
   consistency of conventional perception systems. To address these
   complexities, our research proposes a fully end-to-end deep
   learning-driven perception pipeline specifically optimized for UAV-based
   traffic monitoring. The proposed framwork integrates multiple advanced
   modules: RetinexNet for preprocessing, segmentation using HRNet to
   preserve high-resolution semantic information, and vehicle detection
   using the YOLOv11 framework. Deep SORT is employed for efficient vehicle
   tracking, while CSRNet facilitates high-density vehicle counting. LSTM
   networks are integrated to predict vehicle trajectories based on
   temporal patterns, and a combination of DenseNet and SuperPoint is
   utilized for robust feature extraction. Finally, classification is
   performed using Vision Transformers (ViTs), leveraging attention
   mechanisms to ensure accurate recognition across diverse categories. The
   modular yet unified architecture is designed to handle spatiotemporal
   dynamics, making it suitable for real-time deployment in diverse UAV
   platforms.Method The framework suggests using today's best neural
   networks that are made to solve different problems in aerial vehicle
   analysis. RetinexNet is used in preprocessing to make the lighting of
   each input frame consistent. Using HRNet for semantic segmentation
   allows for accurate splitting between vehicles and their surroundings.
   YOLOv11 provides high precision and quick vehicle detection and Deep
   SORT allows reliable tracking without losing track of individual cars.
   CSRNet are used for vehicle counting that is unaffected by obstacles or
   traffic jams. LSTM models capture how a car moves in time to forecast
   future positions. Combining DenseNet and SuperPoint embeddings that were
   improved with an AutoEncoder is done during feature extraction. In the
   end, using an attention function, Vision Transformer-based models
   classify vehicles seen from above. Every part of the system is developed
   and included to give the improved performance when the UAV is being used
   in real life.Results Our proposed framework significantly improves the
   accuracy, reliability, and efficiency of vehicle analysis from UAV
   imagery. Our pipeline was rigorously evaluated on two famous datasets,
   AU-AIR and Roundabout. On the AU-AIR dataset, the system achieved a
   detection accuracy of 97.8\%, a tracking accuracy of 96.5\%, and a
   classification accuracy of 98.4\%. Similarly, on the Roundabout dataset,
   it reached 96.9\% detection accuracy, 94.4\% tracking accuracy, and
   97.7\% classification accuracy. These results surpass previous
   benchmarks, demonstrating the system's robust performance across diverse
   aerial traffic scenarios. The integration of advanced models, YOLOv11
   for detection, HRNet for segmentation, Deep SORT for tracking, CSRNet
   for counting, LSTM for trajectory prediction, and Vision Transformers
   for classification enables the framework to maintain high accuracy even
   under challenging conditions like occlusion, variable lighting, and
   scale variations.
   Discussion The outcomes show that the chosen deep learning system is
   powerful enough to deal with the challenges of aerial vehicle analysis
   and gives reliable and precise results in all the aforementioned tasks.
   Combining several advanced models ensures that the system works smoothly
   even when dealing with problems like people being covered up and varying
   sizes.},

Abstract = {With the intensification of uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) ``black
   flight{''} threat, the dynamic cooperative deployment of navigation
   spoofing jamming sites faces the triple challenges of integrity
   coverage, spoofing signal mutual interference suppression, and resource
   cost optimization. In this paper, we propose an intelligent deployment
   framework that breaks through the limitations of traditional algorithms
   of fixing the number of stations, fixing the radius, and optimizing only
   the location of stations. By constructing a multi-objective optimization
   model, we innovatively design a hybrid optimization mechanism that
   includes velocity-position update with local-best-driven, site-adaptive
   maintenance, and directed mutation. Among them, the local-best-driven
   module generates particle motion gradients through site-level
   dual-objective evaluation to solve the global guidance failure problem
   in dynamic scenarios; the site-adaptive maintenance module achieves
   site-level dynamic optimization through the judgement of site absence
   and redundancy; and the directed mutation module further optimizes the
   redundant resources through the transformation of inefficient sites.
   Simulation results demonstrate that this method significantly improves
   the reliability and economy of the deployment of the active protection
   system in the complex electromagnetic environment and provides

Abstract = {A multi-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-aided secure communication
   network is studied, where multiple information UAVs carrying temporary
   aerial base stations transmit confidential information to multiple
   authorized receivers (ARs), and a jammer UAV is employed to send
   artificial noise to multiple unauthorized receivers (URs) for mitigating
   information leakage. Some practical constrains including the inter-UAV
   interference among the information UAVs and the jammer UAV, the maximal
   available propulsion energy at UAVs, and the curvature radius
   limitations of UAVs' trajectories are concurrently taken into account.
   In order to maximize the minimum secrecy rate among the ARs, the AR
   scheduling, theUAVs' power allocation and the trajectories ofUAVs are
   jointly optimized by formulating a multi-variable optimization problem.
   To solve the non-convex problem efficiently, we present a block
   coordinate descent (BCD)-based approach, where the penalty dual
   decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is designed to optimize the AR
   scheduling, and successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is
   proposed to optimize theUAVs' power allocation and the trajectories of
   UAVs. The complexity of the presented BCD-based approach is analyzed,
   which achieves polynomial complexity. Simulation results show that
   imposing curvature radius limitations on the UAVs' trajectory design is
   effective to avoid sharp turning of UAVs. Moreover, as curvature radius
   increases, the system max-min secrecy rate decreases. Besides, the
   secrecy rate performance of the system can be enhanced by exploiting one
   jammer UAV to interfere with the URs.},

Title = {Fast Cascade Retrieval Method for UAV Images with GNSS Rejection},
Journal = {ACTA OPTICA SINICA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {44},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Objective Our research is of great importance for improving the
   autonomous positioning ability of UAVs, advancing the development of
   remote sensing image technology, and enhancing the widespread
   application of UAVs. Simultaneously, it addresses the challenge of GNSS
   signal interference, enhances the accuracy and efficiency of image
   retrieval, and meets the real-time processing needs of UAVs. In complex
   environments where GNSS signals are disrupted or rejected, traditional
   positioning methods prove ineffective. The fast cascade retrieval method
   we proposed significantly strengthens retrieval accuracy and efficiency
   by comprehensively utilizing local image features and adopting a two-
   level retrieval strategy. The method demonstrates feasibility and
   practicality in real-time processing, which provides reliable
   positioning support for UAVs in surveying and mapping, firefighting,
   agriculture, transportation, rescue, and military applications. This
   research holds crucial practical significance and immediate necessity.
   Methods We propose a fast cascade retrieval method for UAV images under
   GNSS rejection conditions, which achieves rapid positioning through a
   two- stage retrieval process (Fig. 1). Initially, a subset of aerial
   image datasets from Vienna, Austria, and Chicago, USA, along with
   corresponding commercial satellite image data, is selected for the
   experiment. To ensure data consistency and comparability, these images
   are cropped and size- normalized for subsequent retrieval. Subsequently,
   hash codes and feature point data are extracted from satellite images to
   construct hash and feature point databases, respectively, thereby
   improving retrieval efficiency and avoiding redundant calculations. In
   the initial retrieval stage, the wavelet hashing method is employed by
   incorporating spatial information. This method extracts low- frequency
   spatial components from the image using wavelet transform, generates
   hash codes, and utilizes these codes for rapid retrieval. The specific
   steps are as follows. First, the satellite image undergoes wavelet
   transformation to extract low- frequency components, and then the
   resulting hash codes are stored in the hash database. Similarly, the UAV
   image is processed to generate corresponding hash codes, which are used
   for rapid matching to identify candidate sets of satellite images
   similar to that of UAVs. In the secondary retrieval stage, an improved
   superpoint fast feature retrieval network (ISFFRN, Fig. 2) is employed
   to further retrieve and rank images based on local features of both UAV
   and satellite images. The steps involve using the ISFFRN to extract
   local feature points from UAV and candidate satellite images, followed
   by matching these feature points and calculating the number of matched
   pairs. The retrieval results are then sorted based on the number of
   matching point pairs to determine the final retrieval outcomes. The
   entire experiment is conducted using the Jetson AGX Orin hardware device
   to evaluate the method's feasibility and real-time performance on an
   actual airborne platform. Results and Discussions The fast cascade
   retrieval method for UAV images with GNSS rejection proposed in this
   paper performs well on Jetson AGX Orin hardware devices, with an average
   processing time controlled within 0.5 s to meet the requirements of
   real-time positioning tasks.
   In the first retrieval stage, the wavelet hashing method is used to
   generate hash codes by extracting low- frequency spatial information
   from the image, and a candidate set of similar satellite images is
   quickly selected through matching (Figs. 4 and 5). Experimental results
   demonstrate that the wavelet hashing algorithm effectively captures
   global features and texture information from the image, which exhibits
   good adaptability and robustness. In the second retrieval stage, the
   ISFFRN is employed to determine the final retrieval results by
   extracting local feature points from UAV images and candidate satellite
   images, followed by matching and sorting. Experiments show that the
   ISFFRN completes the retrieval based on the ToCP@1 index (Figs. 6 and
   7), confirming the feasibility of the ISFFRN for heterogeneous image
   retrieval (Fig. 8). Regarding performance evaluation, the entire
   experimental process is conducted on image data from Vienna, Austria,
   and Chicago, USA, utilizing Jetson AGX Orin hardware equipment, with
   experiment times recorded (Tables 4 and 5). Experimental results show
   that the cascade retrieval method can successfully achieve fast
   retrieval of UAV images. In the first search, ToCP@1 is 0, which
   indicates that the correct UAV image is not directly matched by the
   first satellite image after sorting the search results. However, ToCP@6
   is 50 degrees o, which indicates that the correctly matched satellite
   image ranks second among the first six retrieved images. Although it
   does not achieve direct matching initially, it significantly narrows
   down the retrieval range and successfully locates the target image in
   subsequent results. In the second retrieval, ToCP@1 is 100 degrees o
   following the screening from the first retrieval. This demonstrates the
   cascade retrieval method's effectiveness in accurately identifying and
   retrieving the correct satellite image, which ranks first in the
   similarity ranking. In summary, the fast cascade retrieval method for
   UAV images under GNSS rejection conditions achieves real-time airborne
   retrieval of UAV images by leveraging both global and local image
   features. The method comprehensively considers the characteristics of
   multi- source remote sensing images and effectively addresses the
   challenge of fast UAV image retrieval in GNSS-rejected environments.
   Conclusions Aiming at the problem of UAV positioning with GNSS
   rejection, we propose a fast cascade retrieval method that combines
   global and local features of satellite and UAV images. Its feasibility
   is verified using airborne equipment. Experimental results demonstrate
   that the two- stage cascade retrieval method achieves an average
   processing time of under 0.5 seconds on Jetson AGX Orin hardware, which
   meets the real-time requirements for GNSS RF and makes it suitable for
   real-time positioning of airborne equipment. In the first retrieval
   stage, the wavelet hash image retrieval algorithm, which integrates
   spatial information, shows robustness under the ToCP@6 index. However,
   adjustments to the hash length are necessary to ensure accuracy when
   dealing with images of varying scales. In the secondary retrieval, the
   ISFFRN successfully completes retrieval under the ToCP@1 index, thus
   confirming the feasibility of ISFFRN in heterogeneous image retrieval.
   To conclude, by leveraging both global and local image features, our
   method achieves real-time airborne retrieval of UAV images, which
   effectively tackles the challenge of fast UAV image retrieval in
   GNSS-denied environments.
   It exhibits high accuracy and robustness, meeting experimental
   expectations.},

Title = {Robust Anti-Jamming Technique for UAV Data Collection in IoT Using
   Landing Platforms and RIS},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {11},
Pages = {70635-70651},
Abstract = {Adopting Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in wireless networks provides
   promising methods to extend the coverage of the network. However, the
   uplink communications between the ground devices and the UAV are
   vulnerable to jamming. Although many works have exploited the
   maneuverability of the UAV to avoid the jammer, the UAV will not be
   effective when the jammer is impacting a large area. In this paper, the
   data collection problem in Internet of Things (IoT) using a UAV in the
   presence of a meliaceous jammer is investigated. A Reconfigurable
   Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) is adopted to help the ground IoT devices in
   reflecting their signals toward the UAV. Moreover, a novel network
   element, called Landing Platform (LP), is introduced to support a
   resilient data collection in the presence of high jamming power using
   network cables. A joint IoT devices clustering and UAV's trajectory
   planning is considered, where the problem is formulated mathematically.
   Then, the Ant Colony-based Algorithm for Joint Anti-jamming UAV Routing
   and IoT Devices Clustering (AC-JRC) is introduced to solve the
   optimization problem in an efficient way. Finally, the impact of the LPs
   and the performance of AC-JRC algorithm compared with other benchmarks
   is investigated. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the
   UAV's total traveled distance and the number of used LPs. It is shown
   that the solution of AC-JRC is within 9\% of the optimal solution.
   Moreover, the AC-JRC algorithm can provide a solution better than the
   solutions of AC-kmeans and ACS algorithms by 17\% and 61\%,
   respectively.},

Title = {2chADCNN: A Template Matching Network for Season-Changing UAV Aerial
   Images and Satellite Imagery},
Journal = {DRONES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Visual navigation based on image matching has become one of the most
   important research fields for UAVs to achieve autonomous navigation,
   because of its low cost, strong anti-jamming ability, and high
   performance. Currently, numerous positioning and navigation methods
   based on visual information have been proposed for UAV navigation.
   However, the appearance, shape, color, and texture of objects can change
   significantly due to different lighting conditions, shadows, and surface
   coverage during different seasons, such as vegetation cover in summer or
   ice and snow cover in winter. These changes pose greater challenges for
   feature-based image matching methods. This encouraged us to overcome the
   limitations of previous works, which did not consider significant
   seasonal changes such as snow-covered UAV aerial images, by proposing an
   image matching method using season-changing UAV aerial images and
   satellite imagery. Following the pipeline of a two-channel deep
   convolutional neural network, we first pre-scaled the UAV aerial images,
   ensuring that the UAV aerial images and satellite imagery had the same
   ground sampling distance. Then, we introduced attention mechanisms to
   provide additional supervision for both low-level local features and
   high-level global features, resulting in a new season-specific feature
   representation. The similarity between image patches was calculated
   using a similarity measurement layer composed of two fully connected
   layers. Subsequently, we conducted template matching to estimate the UAV
   matching position with the highest similarity. Finally, we validated our
   proposed method on both synthetic and real UAV aerial image datasets,
   and conducted direct comparisons with previous popular works. The
   experimental results demonstrated that our method achieved the highest
   matching accuracy on multi-temporal and multi-season images.},

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are anticipated to be a potential data
   collection solution for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The main
   challenges of integrating UAVs in WSNs are security threats and UAV's
   onboard energy limitation. To cope with these two challenges, this
   article examines the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) maximization
   problem in UAV-enabled WSN. Specifically, a full-duplex (FD) UAV gathers
   confidential information from ground sensor nodes (SNs) in the uplink
   while sending jamming signals to confound a ground eavesdropper (Eve) in
   the downlink. Considering a passive eavesdropping scenario lacking Eve's
   instantaneous channel state information (CSI), the resulting problem is
   subject to the constraints of connection outage probability (COP),
   secrecy outage probability (SOP), securely collected bits, and flight
   trajectory. To tackle the intractable nonconvex problem, we first derive
   the optimal codeword rate and redundancy rate in closed-form expressions
   and then develop a low-complexity algorithm using the block coordinate
   descent (BCD) approach to alternatively optimize the SN scheduling, SN
   transmit power, UAV transmit power, and UAV trajectory. Simulation
   results verify the performance gains of the proposed scheme compared
   with the benchmark schemes. In particular, the proposed scheme achieves
   nearly the same secrecy rate gains at a lower UAV's energy consumption
   cost than the sum secrecy rate maximization (SSRM) baseline. Moreover,
   it is revealed that trajectory optimization of the proposed scheme plays
   a crucial role in improving SEE performance compared with the circle
   trajectory (CT) baseline.},

Abstract = {We consider how to protect Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) from Global
   Positioning System (GPS) spoofing attacks to provide safe navigation.
   The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is widely used for
   locating drones and is by far the most popular navigation solution. This
   is because of the simplicity and relatively low cost of this technology,
   as well as the accuracy of the transmitted coordinates. Nevertheless,
   there are many security threats to GPS navigation. These are primarily
   related to the nature of the GPS signal, as an intruder can jam and
   spoof the GPS signal. We discuss methods of protection against this type
   of attack and have developed an experimental stand and conducted
   scenarios of attacks on a drone's GPS system. Data from the UAV's flight
   log were collected and analyzed in order to see the attack's impact on
   sensor readings. From this we identify a new method for detecting UAV
   anomalies by analyzing changes in internal parameters of the UAV. This

Abstract = {The dynamic development of microelectronics and wireless communication
   at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries contributed to the increase
   in the availability and popularity of all kinds of unmanned platforms,
   air, land, surface, and underwater. In the case of unmanned aerial
   vehicles (UAVs), also popularly known as drones, the significant
   (crucial) advantages are high freedom of motion (i.e., the ability to
   move in three planes) and the possibility of using it practically
   anywhere (as opposed to water platforms). These factors influenced the
   dynamic development of this market sector and the high availability of
   various models and equipment. UAVs are being used in many sectors and
   services, both for civil and military purposes. Widespread availability,
   low cost, and ease of use also favor the possibility of using civilian
   UAVs for criminal, smuggling, terrorist, or military purposes. Recent
   armed conflicts, e.g., in Nagorno-Karabakh or Ukraine, and the situation
   on the eastern Polish-Belarusian border clearly show this. All countries
   recognize the potential and threat posed by the development of unmanned
   platforms. Therefore, for several years, special attention has been paid
   to analyses and research in sensors, effectors, and anti-drone systems.
   It is worth emphasizing that some effectors (e.g., jammers or spoofers)
   may significantly affect the navigation process of neighboring objects
   that use global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs). On the other hand,
   the use of anti-drone systems is important, especially in the context of
   protecting institutions and facilities of companies, state
   administration (i.a., embassies, consulates), army, strategic importance
   objects (e.g., related to energy, chemical industry), or protection of
   mass events. In this paper, we present an overview of solutions
   available on the market and development directions in the field of
   anti-drone technology.},

Abstract = {Threats of eavesdropping and information leakages have increased sharply
   owing to advancements in wireless communication technology. In
   particular, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become vulnerable to
   sniffing or jamming attacks because broadcast communication is usually
   conducted in open-network environments. Although improved security
   protocols have been proposed to overcome the limitations of
   wireless-communication technology and to secure safe communication
   channels, they are difficult to apply to mobile communication networks
   and IoT because complex hardware is required. Hence, a novel security
   model with a lighter weight and greater mobility is needed. In this
   paper, we propose a security model applying cooperative friendly jamming
   using artificial noise and drone mobility, which are autonomous moving
   objects, and we demonstrate the prevention of eavesdropping and improved
   security through simulations and field tests. The Cooperative Friendly
   Jamming Techniques for Drone-based Mobile Secure Zone (CFJ-DMZ) can set
   a secure zone in a target area to support a safe wireless mobile
   communication network through friendly jamming, which can effectively
   reduce eavesdropping threats. According to the experimental results, the
   average information leakage rate of the eavesdroppers in CFJ-DMZ-applied
   scenarios was less than or equal to 3\%, an average improvement of 92\%

Abstract = {With the massive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
   disaster relief, fire protection, security and other fields, jamming
   countermeasures to UAVs in airports and competition venues have become
   the core link of security in high-level matches and important places.
   The existing jamming sources are mainly single point jamming. Due to the
   shielding of buildings, it is impossible to fully cover the venue, and
   the existing suppressed jamming will affect the communication
   broadcasting. Here, a distributed optimal jamming method for massive
   UAVs is proposed. Through the identification and positioning of massive
   UAVs, using the location information of distributed jamming sources, the
   UAV jamming architecture based on satellite navigation is constructed.
   Combined with tabu search artificial bee colony theory, the distributed
   optimal jamming of UAVs is realized, which solves the problems of few
   jamming targets, slow speed and low success rate of the existing optimal
   jamming methods. The proposed method is compared with the existing
   methods in three aspects: communication frequency, jamming trajectory
   deviation and optimization speed. The simulation results show that the
   proposed method effectively improves the jamming success rate and
   jamming speed and can meet the application requirements of massive UAV
   jamming in the region.},

Title = {Optimization of False Target Jamming against UAV Detection},
Journal = {DRONES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used for target
   detection in modern battlefields. From the viewpoint of the opponents,
   false target jamming is an effective approach to decrease the UAV
   detection ability or probability, but currently there are few research
   efforts devoted to this adversarial problem. This paper formulates an
   optimization problem of false target jamming based on a counterpart
   problem of UAV detection, where each false target jamming solution is
   evaluated according to its adversarial effects on a set of possible UAV
   detection solutions. To efficiently solve the problem, we propose an
   evolutionary framework, which is implemented with four popular
   evolutionary algorithms by designing/adapting their evolutionary
   operators for false target jamming solutions. Experimental results on 12
   test instances with different search regions and numbers of UAVs and
   false targets demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly
   reduce the UAV detection probability, and the water wave optimization
   (WWO) metaheuristic exhibits the best overall performance among the four
   evolutionary algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first study on
   the optimization of false target jamming against UAV detection, and the
   proposed framework can be extended to more countermeasures against UAV
   operations.},

Title = {Assessment of Android Network Positioning as an Alternative Source of
   Navigation for Drone Operations},
Journal = {DRONES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Applications of drones have increased significantly in the past decade
   for both indoor and outdoor operations. In order to assist autonomous
   drone navigation, there are numerous sensors installed onboard the
   vehicles. These include Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)
   chipsets, inertial sensors, barometer, lidar, radar and vision sensors.
   The two sensors used most often by drone autopilot controllers for
   absolute positioning are the GNSS chipsets and barometer. Although, for
   most outdoor operations, these sensors provide accurate and reliable
   position information, their accuracy, availability, and integrity
   deteriorate for indoor applications and in the presence of radio
   frequency interference (RFI), such as GNSS spoofing and jamming.
   Therefore, it is possible to derive network-based locations from Wi-Fi
   and cellular transmission. Although there have been many theoretical
   studies on network positioning, limited resources are available for the
   expected quantitative performance of these positioning methodologies. In
   this paper, the authors investigate both the horizontal and vertical
   accuracy of the Android network location engines under rural, suburban,
   and urban environments. The paper determines the horizontal location
   accuracy to be approximately 1637 m, 38 m, and 32 m in terms of 68\%
   circular error probable (CEP) for rural, suburban, and urban
   environments, respectively, and the vertical accuracy to be 1.2 m and
   4.6 m in terms of 68\% CEP for suburban and urban environments,
   respectively. In addition, the availability and latency of the location
   engines are explored. Furthermore, the paper assesses the accuracy of
   the Android network location accuracy indicator for various drone
   operation environments. The assessed accuracies of the network locations
   provide a deeper insight into their potential for drone navigation.},

   of the UAVs to evade the (un)-intended interference caused by
   (un)-intentional interferers. To this end, we propose an
   alternating-maximization approach to jointly obtain the 3D trajectories
   and the UAVs transmission powers. We handle the 3D trajectory design by
   resorting to spectral graph theory and subsequently address the power
   allocation through convex optimization techniques. We also approach the
   problem from the intentional interferer's perspective where smart
   jammers chase the UAVs to effectively degrade the data flow of the

Volume = {70},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As the cost and technical difficulty of jamming devices continue to
   decrease, jamming has become one of the major threats to positioning
   service. Unfortunately, most conventional wireless positioning
   technologies are vulnerable to jamming attacks due to inherent
   shortcomings like weak signal strength and unfavorable anchor geometry.
   Thanks to their high operational flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicles
   (UAVs) could be a promising solution to the above challenges. Therefore,
   in this article, we propose a UAV-assisted anti-jamming positioning
   system, in which multiple UAVs first utilize time-difference-of-arrival
   (TDoA) measurements from ground reference stations and double-response
   two-way ranging (DR-TWR) measurements from UAV-to-UAV links to perform
   self-localization as well as clock synchronization, and then act as
   anchor nodes to provide TDoA positioning service for ground users in the
   presence of jamming. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of the
   proposed system, we first derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of
   UAV self-localization. Then, the impacts of UAV position uncertainty and
   synchronization errors caused by jamming on positioning service are
   modeled, and the theoretical root-mean-square error (RMSE) of user
   position estimate is further derived. Numerical results demonstrate that
   the proposed system is a promising alternative to existing positioning
   systems when their services are disrupted by jamming. The most notable
   advantage of the proposed system is that it is fully compatible with
   existing user equipment terminals and positioning methods.},

Abstract = {The current state of the art on jamming detection relies on link-layer
   metrics. A few examples are the bit-error rate (BER), the packet
   delivery ratio, the throughput, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As
   a result, these techniques can only detect jamming ex-post, i.e., once
   the attack has already taken down the communication link. These
   solutions are unfit for mobile devices, e.g., drones, which might lose
   the connection to the remote controller, being unable to predict the
   attack. Our solution is rooted in the idea that a drone unknowingly
   flying toward a jammed area is experiencing an increasing effect of the
   jamming, e.g., in terms of BER and SNR. Therefore, drones might use the
   abovementioned phenomenon to detect jamming before the increase of the
   BER and the decrease of the SNR completely disrupt the communication
   link. Such an approach would allow drones and their pilots to make
   informed decisions and maintain complete control of navigation,
   enhancing security and safety. This article proposes Bloodhound+, a
   solution for jamming detection on mobile devices in low-BER regimes. Our
   approach analyzes raw physical-layer information (I-Q samples) acquired
   from the wireless channel. We assemble this information into grayscale
   images and use sparse autoencoders to detect image anomalies caused by
   jamming attacks. To test our solution against a broad set of
   configurations, we acquired a large data set of indoor measurements
   using multiple hardware, jamming strategies, and communication
   parameters. Our results indicate that Bloodhound+ can detect indoor
   jamming up to 20 m from the jamming source at the minimum available
   relative jamming power, with a minimum accuracy of 99.7\%. Our solution
   is also robust to various sampling rates adopted by the jammer and to
   the type of signal used for jamming.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates a multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},

Pages = {31496-31507},
Abstract = {In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant
   popularity and are used for many applications, from entertainment to
   surveillance and the modern battlefield. As regulation demands arose
   worldwide, controling and reacting to unauthorized flights of UAVs
   became a pressing issue. In this work, we present an algorithm to
   accelerate the training of a reinforcement learning drone agent for a
   counter unmanned aerial system (C-UAS). The main objective of this C-UAS
   is to guide an invading drone to a safe-killing zone (SZ) using a hunter
   quadrotor drone. The hunter quadrotor launches a spoofing, or meaconing,
   attack on the GNSS receiver of the invading drone. The proposed
   algorithms employ an abstraction of the C-UAS problem to accelerate the
   training step and enable training during the mission. Results for
   different SZ radii are discussed using a software-in-the-loop simulation
   for ground truth based on a detailed model of the UAV embedded system
   and flight dynamics, including error metrics and action time. We show
   that a 99\% probability of successful target steering to the SZ can be
   achieved considering a SZ radius of 75 meters and a Q-table trained with
   the proposed accelerated training model.},

Title = {GNSS-denied geolocalization of UAVs using terrain-weighted constraint
   optimization},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {135},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Accurate geolocation using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is
   essential for safe and long-range unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
   flights. However, GNSS systems are susceptible to blockages, jamming,
   and spoofing attacks. Localization using onboard cameras and satellite
   images provides a promising solution for UAVs operating in GNSS-denied
   environments. In this paper, we developed a novel UAV visual
   localization system for GNSS-denied situations, both day and night, that
   integrates image matching, visual odometry (VO), and terrain-weighted
   constraint optimization. First, an effective map management strategy is
   designed for satellite image chunking, real-time scheduling, and
   merging. Then, a 2D-3D geo-registration method, combining Bidirectional
   Homologous Points Search, is introduced to obtain accurate 3D virtual
   control points for UAV absolute localization. Lastly, a position
   estimation and optimization method, integrating the sliding window with
   terrain weighting constraints, is proposed to control position error
   accumulation and reduce position drift. Twenty experiments were
   conducted in typical and complex scenarios to validate our system's
   resilience to altitude changes, trajectory variations, and rolling
   terrain. Our system demonstrated drift-free and viewpoint-robust,
   maintaining stability even in feature-poor environments and seasonal
   variations. It does not require loop closure, allowing for
   re-localization after positioning failures. Additionally, we utilized
   thermal infrared images to demonstrate the system's performance in
   night-time conditions. With a Mean Absolute Error of less than 7 m, it
   can be a powerful complement to GNSS in the event of GNSS-Denied
   environments. All demonstration videos of our system can be found at

Abstract = {The high-precision navigation and positioning ability of UAV (Unmanned
   Aerial Vehicles) is the key factor to reflect its degree of automation.
   Visual navigation based on image matching has become one of the
   important research fields for UAV to realize autonomous navigation,
   because of its low cost, strong anti-jamming ability, and good location
   result. However, the visual quality of images captured by UAV will be
   seriously affected by some factors, such as weak illumination conditions
   or insufficient performance of its sensors. Resolving a series of
   degradation of low-light images can improve the visual quality and
   enhance the performance of UAV visual navigation. In this paper, we
   propose a novel fully convolutional network based on the Retinex theory
   to solve the degradations of low-light images captured by UAV, which can
   improve the visual quality of the images and visual matching performance
   effectively. At the same time, a visual navigation system is designed
   based on the proposed network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
   our method outperforms the existing methods by a large margin both
   quantitatively and qualitatively, and effectively improves the
   performance of the image matching algorithms. The visual navigation
   system can successfully realize the self-localization of UAV under
   different illumination conditions. Moreover, we also prove that our
   method is also effective in other practical tasks (e.g. autonomous
   driving).},

   GNSS Receivers},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {20},
Pages = {3550-3565},
Abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are fundamental in
   ubiquitously providing position and time to a wide gamut of systems.
   Jamming remains a realistic threat in many deployment settings, civilian
   and tactical. Specifically, in drones sustained denial raises safety
   critical concerns. This work presents a strategy that allows detection,
   localization, and classification both in the frequency and time domain
   of interference signals harmful to navigation. A high-performance
   Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) drone with a single antenna and a
   commercial GNSS receiver is used to geolocate and characterize RF
   emitters at long range, to infer the navigation impairment. Raw IQ
   baseband snapshots from the GNSS receiver make the application of
   spectral correlation methods possible without extra software-defined
   radio payload, paving the way to spectrum identification and monitoring
   in airborne platforms, aiming at RF situational awareness. Live testing
   at Jammertest, in Norway, with portable, commercially available GNSS
   multi-band jammers demonstrates the ability to detect, localize, and
   characterize harmful interference. Our system pinpointed the position
   with an error of a few meters of the transmitter and the extent of the
   affected area at long range, without entering the denied zone.
   Additionally, further spectral content extraction is used to accurately
   identify the jammer frequency, bandwidth, and modulation scheme based on
   spectral correlation techniques.},

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles rely heavily on global navigation satellite
   systems (GNSSs) for positioning and navigation when performing tasks. At
   the same time, low-cost GNSS jammers can pose a severe threat to the use

   this article proposes an interference mitigation method based on the Zak
   transform to mitigate the impact of interference on GNSS receivers. The
   proposed method takes advantage of the sparsity of the interfering
   signal at the Doppler shift axis of the delay-Doppler domain to obtain
   an estimation of the interference signal, which is then subtracted from
   the received GNSS signal to remove the interference. Simulation results
   show that the proposed method is more effective in mitigating
   interference than other methods reported in the literature.},

Abstract = {Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are the main navigation and

Title = {A Deep-Learning-Based GPS Signal Spoofing Detection Method for Small
   UAVs},
Journal = {DRONES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The navigation of small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) mainly depends
   on global positioning systems (GPSs). However, GPSs are vulnerable to
   attack by spoofing, which causes the UAVs to lose their positioning
   ability. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning method to
   detect the spoofing of GPS signals received by small UAVs. Firstly, we
   describe the GPS signal dataset acquisition and preprocessing methods;
   these include the hardware system of the UAV and the jammer used in the
   experiment, the time and weather conditions of the data collection, the
   use of Spearman correlation coefficients for preprocessing, and the use
   of SVM-SMOTE to solve the spoofing data imbalance. Next, we introduce a
   PCA-CNN-LSTM model. We used principal component analysis (PCA) of the
   model to extract feature information related to spoofing from the GPS
   signal dataset. The convolutional neural network (CNN) in the model was
   used to extract local features in the GPS signal dataset, and long
   short-term memory (LSTM) was used as a posterior module of the CNN for
   further processing and modeling. To minimize randomness and chance in
   the simulation experiments, we used the 10-fold cross-validation method
   to train and evaluate the computational performance of our spoofing
   machine learning model. We conducted a series of experiments in a
   numerical simulation environment and evaluated the proposed model
   against the most advanced traditional machine learning and deep learning
   models. The results and analysis show that the PCA-CNN-LSTM neural
   network model achieved the highest accuracy (0.9949). This paper
   provides a theoretical basis and technical support for spoofing
   detection for small-UAV GPS signals.},

Abstract = {In a conventional Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) navigational system
   Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sensor is often a main source
   of data for trajectory generation. Even video tracking based systems
   need some GNSS data for proper work. The goal of this study is to
   develop an optics-based system to estimate the ground speed of the UAV
   in the case of the GNSS failure, jamming, or unavailability. The
   proposed approach uses a camera mounted on the fuselage belly of the
   UAV. We can obtain the ground speed of the airplane by using the digital
   cropping, the stabilization of the real time image, and template
   matching algorithms. By combining the ground speed vector components
   with measurements of airspeed and altitude, the wind velocity and drift
   are computed. The obtained data were used to improve efficiency of the
   video-tracking based on a navigational system. An algorithm allows this
   computation to be performed in real time on board of a UAV. The
   algorithm was tested in Software-in-the-loop and implemented on the UAV
   hardware. Its effectiveness has been demonstrated through the
   experimental test results. The presented work could be useful for

Volume = {4},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Many common navigation solutions fall short when an aircraft's GPS
   signal is either jammed or spoofed. This is typically due to the
   iterative nature of the estimation process, which requires an acceptably
   accurate initial estimate, or due to the accumulated error of inertial
   sensors, which are unable to directly observe the position of an
   aircraft. A mechanism is presented in this paper which operates on
   qualitative information, allowing an aircraft to remain within a
   vicinity despite an absence of precision localization. A long -short
   -term -memory neural network was used for time series classification of
   radio signal strength data on a light weight fixed wing UAV. Simulation
   results show that the two class classifier is able to determine the
   motion of an aircraft with respect to a radio beacon with 97.73\%
   accuracy. The classes used for classification represent motion as either
   towards, or away from a beacon. A simple high level controller was
   designed to use the classification output and converge on a beacon.
   Results from this paper indicate that this unique application of
   qualitative navigation by the application of time series classification
   offers a viable alternative to aircraft navigation in GPS denied

   However, autopilot systems fail to navigate due to lost or jammed GNSS

Year = {2023},
Volume = {109},
Number = {3},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) has been the primary
   positioning solution for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) due to their
   worldwide coverage, high precision and lightweight receivers. However,
   GNSS is prone to electromagnetic interference and malicious assaults,
   including jamming or spoofing because of its low signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR). To ensure the continuity and protection of UAV operations, using
   redundant navigation systems is essential. In recent years, the phased
   array radio system (PARS) has established itself as a local navigation
   solution. PARS is robust towards malicious assaults because of an much
   higher SNR than GNSS regarding directed and encrypted transmission. An
   essential factor of PARS is that the orientation of the radio antenna at
   a ground station needs to be precisely determined to obtain the correct
   positioning of UAVs. This paper presents a method for extending a
   previously proposed calibration algorithm to estimate the ground antenna
   orientation with an inertial navigation system (INS) aided by redundant
   positioning sensors (GNSS, PARS or barometer) using a multiplicative
   extended Kalman filter (MEKF) so that the calibration can be activated
   during flights whenever GNSS is available. In other words, the proposed
   navigation system is essentially an aided-INS which switches between two
   modes depending on the availability of GNSS: calibration and GNSS aiding
   mode when GNSS is available (Mode 1) and PARS and barometer aiding mode
   when GNSS is unavailable (Mode 2). Considering that the navigation
   system needs to include the effect of Earth's curvature for a
   long-distance flight, PARS horizontal measurement and the barometer
   measurement were treated independently, and the navigation equations
   were propagated in Earth Centred Earth Fixed (ECEF) frame. The
   independent treatment of barometer measurement, and the propagation in
   ECEF frame were also beneficial when using multiple ground antennas to
   have a common reference point and reference frame. The proposed method
   was validated using data (Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), GNSS, PARS,
   Pixhawk autopilot (including barometer) measurements) collected during a
   field test. In the validation, GNSS was made available at the middle of
   the flight and the calibration mode was activated for 200s. The proposed
   navigation system successfully estimated the precise orientation of
   multiple ground antennas and the navigation solutions were verified
   using GNSS and Pixhawk autopilot solutions as ground truth.},

   the UAVs' locations and jamming power to maximize the minimum position
   error of unauthorized users, while ensuring that the needs of legitimate
   users are met. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, an
   iterative algorithm based on the block coordinate descent and successive
   convex approximation techniques is proposed and applied. Numerical
   results demonstrate that the proposed scheme could prevent the
   unauthorized use of positioning services and outperforms the benchmark
   schemes.},

Title = {SSTM: Semantic Segmentation-based Template Matching method for
   heterogenous images},
Journal = {INFRARED PHYSICS \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {136},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) have disadvantages such as
   signal interference, loss, and spoofing. This has led to the development
   of new methods to complement or replace satellite navigation. Absolute
   visual localization is one of the main methods of vision-based
   localization. The goal is to localize the current view of the UAV in a
   reference satellite map or in a georeferenced image of a previous
   flight. During nighttime, due to poor lighting conditions, infrared
   images are used as a substitute for visible light images. However, the
   significant differences between infrared and visible light images pose
   challenges in matching them. Therefore, this paper proposes a Semantic
   Segmentation-based Template Matching (SSTM) method for heterogeneous
   images. The method proposed in this paper breaks the general idea of
   using a single feature extraction algorithm for het-erogeneous image
   matching. In this paper, the matching of UAV infrared images with
   visible light satellite remote sensing images is realized by unifying
   two different image feature extraction modules of the feature
   description language and the matching scheme of this feature description
   language. The advantages of this method are demonstrated through
   comparisons with other advanced techniques. With the development of
   se-mantic segmentation techniques, it is believed that this modular
   ``translation{''} method can achieve matching between arbitrary sensors.},

Title = {Improved GNSS Localization and Byzantine Detection in UAV Swarms},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Many tasks performed by swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles require
   localization. In many cases, the sensors that take part in the
   localization process suffer from inherent measurement errors. This
   problem is amplified when disruptions are added, either endogenously
   through Byzantine failures of agents within the swarm, or exogenously by
   some external source, such as a GNSS jammer. In this paper, we first
   introduce an improved localization method based on distance observation.
   Then, we devise schemes for detecting Byzantine agents, in scenarios of
   endogenous disruptions, and for detecting a disrupted area, in case the
   source of the problem is exogenous. Finally, we apply pool testing
   techniques to reduce the communication traffic and the computation time
   of our schemes. The optimal pool size should be chosen carefully, as
   very small or very large pools may impair the ability to identify the
   source/s of disruption. A set of simulated experiments demonstrates the
   effectiveness of our proposed methods, which enable reliable error
   estimation even amid disruptions. This work is the first, to the best of
   our knowledge, that embeds identification of endogenous and exogenous
   disruptions into the localization process.},

Abstract = {Redundant navigation systems are critical for safe operation of UAVs in
   high-risk environments. Since most commercial UAVs almost wholly rely on
   GPS, jamming, interference, and multi-pathing are real concerns that
   usually limit their operations to low-risk environments and visual
   line-of-sight. This letter presents a vision-based route-following
   system for the autonomous, safe return of UAVs under primary navigation
   failure such as GPS jamming. Using a Visual Teach and Repeat framework
   to build a visual map of the environment during an outbound flight, we
   show the autonomous return of the UAV by visually localizing the live
   view to this map when a simulated GPS failure occurs, controlling the
   vehicle to follow the safe outbound path back to the launch point. Using
   gimbal-stabilized stereo vision and inertial sensing alone, without
   reliance on external infrastructure, Visual Odometry and localization
   are achieved at altitudes of 5-25 m and flight speeds up to 55 km/h. We
   examine the performance of the visual localization algorithm under a
   variety of conditions and also demonstrate closed-loop autonomy along a

Abstract = {We propose JAM-ME, an autonomous jamming-assisted navigation system that
   allows a drone to accomplish its mission even in the presence of an
   anti-drone jamming protection system. In this contribution, we review
   the current state-of-the-art highlighting how current solutions to
   respond to drones are completely ineffective against JAM-ME. In
   particular, we introduce our solution and its theoretical framework, and
   later we relax a few constraints of the baseline model (adding wind
   drift, and allowing the target to be randomly placed within the jammed
   area). Moreover, we run extensive simulations that do support our
   findings: even under the combined action of jamming and wind drift, the
   drone can reach a target randomly deployed in the jamming area-any other
   drone, under the same conditions, would have simply failed. As per the
   overhead, under very conservative assumptions, JAM-ME experiences an
   average overhead of 70\%; however, note that such overhead can be
   reduced by at least a tenfold factor in practical settings-discussed in
   the paper. Finally, we highlight the intrinsic limitations of our

Abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are being more and more widely deployed.
   Although, initially most UAVs were controlled by a pilot, autonomy has

   crucial importance. Fortunately, this can be reliably obtained from a

   analyzes the risk posed by off-the-shelf civilian GPS jammers to UAVs.
   Then, as the main contribution of this paper, a countermeasure is
   described and implemented using custom hardware and software that allows
   the control radio to be used as a backup navigation source. Finally, the

   navigation system is disturbed at 1 watt of interference power, it will
   take 1000 watts to disrupt navigation system working on our proposed

Volume = {9},
Pages = {134369-134383},
Abstract = {In modern-day multi-dimensional recreational drones (UAVs), the global
   navigation satellite system (GNSS) units in- use are commonly fraught
   with precise-point-positioning (PPP) data errors or inaccuracies, hence,
   necessitating this work. These data inaccuracies, occasioned by the
   system's drawbacks such as sudden GPS lock or jamming, embedded device
   misalignment, drone's limited communication coverage, signaling and
   detection, all contributes to the system's PPP computation complexity.
   To mitigate PPP complexity, an intelligent and robust accurate
   continuous-discrete (ACD) based hybrid cubature-extended Kalman filter
   (C-EKF) computation model for an integrated GNSS unit is corroborated in
   this article. More precisely, time updates to the state and parameter
   sub-vectors for the GNSS unit is accomplished using the third-degree
   spherical-radial cubature rule. The system's testbed simulation is then
   conducted using tightly-coupled units of (i) ring laser gyroscope (RLG)
   and (ii) micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) variants of the inertial
   measurement unit (IMU) to ascertain the PPP cooperative tendencies.
   Optimized performance comparisons of the proposed hybrid C-EKF over the

Abstract = {Performance of global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) mounted on

   considering practical applications of satellite navigation in passenger
   aircrafts, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), helicopters and fighters.
   Different algorithms and methods have been proposed for detection of

   their demanding weight, size and computational complexity, when embedded
   on aerial systems. In this study, the authors develop a theoretical
   framework to detect the presence of the threat of UAVs. The idea is
   based on the fact that, due to the UAV motion, the samples of received
   signal power from a fixed threat and from a GNSS satellite have
   different empirical probability density functions. Moreover, by using
   two antennas (an omnidirectional and a down-tilted-directional), they
   introduce a new method to distinguish between aerial and ground-based
   threats. The proposed algorithms have a low-computational burden and can
   consider the fading loss as well. Simulation results show the superior

Abstract = {This is a study on the development of a road following vision-based

   applications. Currently, autonomous navigation requires the use of GPS.
   In many applications, however, dependence on GPS is undesirable. GPS
   signals are weak and can be jammed easily. Also, GPS waypoints may not
   be up-to-date. In recent years, vision-based navigation has been gaining
   popularity. Vision-based guidance requires existence of visible paths or
   extended landmarks for air vehicles to detect and follow. Roads are the
   most commonly available path to follow. Moreover, the abundance of
   events that happen along roads make them appealing subjects of
   surveillance. Many road detection (single images) and road tracking
   (videos) algorithms have been proposed in the literature. Fast detection
   and tracking has been the emphasis of those intended for UAVs. Due to
   the complexity of road detection, we not only need advanced software but
   also the most effective sensors. In this paper, we propose a road

   of Drones},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {For many applications, drones are required to operate entirely or
   partially autonomously. In order to fly completely or partially on their
   own, drones need to access location services for navigation commands.
   While using the Global Positioning System (GPS) is an obvious choice,
   GPS is not always available, can be spoofed or jammed, and is highly
   error-prone for indoor and underground environments. The ranging method
   using beacons is one of the most popular methods for localization,
   especially for indoor environments. In general, the localization error
   in this class is due to two factors: the ranging error, and the error
   induced by the relative geometry between the beacons and the target
   object to be localized. This paper proposes OPTILOD (Optimal Beacon
   Placement for High-Accuracy Indoor Localization of Drones), an
   optimization algorithm for the optimal placement of beacons deployed in
   three-dimensional indoor environments. OPTILOD leverages advances in
   evolutionary algorithms to compute the minimum number of beacons and
   their optimal placement, thereby minimizing the localization error.
   These problems belong to the Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) class and
   are both considered NP-hard. Despite this, OPTILOD can provide multiple
   optimal beacon configurations that minimize the localization error and
   the number of deployed beacons concurrently and efficiently.},

Title = {Assessing the impact of overhead agrivoltaic systems on GNSS signal
   performance for precision agriculture},
Journal = {SMART AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Agrivoltaic systems, which integrate solar energy production with
   agricultural practices, present a sustainable solution to optimize land
   use. However, specific configurations, such as overhead solar panels,
   can obstruct Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, which
   are vital for precision agriculture technologies. This study
   investigates the impact of an agrivoltaic system on GNSS signal
   performance compared to a conventional orchard in Kressbronn am
   Bodensee, Germany, using data from multiple GNSS constellations (GPS,
   GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou). Key metrics such as carrier-to-noise density
   ratio (C/N0), positional accuracy, time to first fix (TTFF), and
   dilution of precision (DOP) were analyzed. The results showed
   significant signal degradation under the overhead agrivoltaic system,
   particularly in C/N0 and positional accuracy. While there were no
   significant differences in DOP metrics or TTFF, the average C/N0
   decreased from 30.62 dB-Hz in the conventional orchard to 26.92 dB-Hz in
   the agrivoltaic system. Moreover, the average of satellites with C/N0
   values below 24 dB-Hz was notably higher in the agrivoltaic area,
   indicating critical signal degradation. In addition, relying on a single
   constellation, like GPS, may not provide enough satellites for reliable
   GNSS performance. Despite the lower signal quality, the average number
   of satellites with C/N0 above 24 dB-Hz remained over 22 in both areas.
   Combined with slight or no significant differences in other metrics
   compared to the conventional orchard, this suggests GNSS-based systems
   can support precision agriculture tasks within the agrivoltaic
   environment. The study highlights the importance of addressing signal
   interference to avoid hindering the integration of drones, robots, and
   other advanced technologies in agrivoltaics management, and suggests
   alternative solutions, such as Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) correction or
   Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques, to enhance
   performance. These findings are critical as agrivoltaic adoption grows,
   requiring a balance between solar energy production and the operational
   needs of precision agriculture.},

Title = {Deep Learning-Based Navigation System for Automatic Landing Approach of
   Fixed-Wing UAVs in GNSS-Denied Environments},
Journal = {AEROSPACE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR 10},
Abstract = {The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is widely used in various
   applications of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) that require precise
   positioning or navigation. However, GNSS signals can be blocked in
   specific environments and are susceptible to jamming and spoofing, which
   will degrade the performance of navigation systems. In this study, a
   deep learning-based navigation system for the automatic landing of
   fixed-wing UAVs in GNSS-denied environments is proposed to serve as an
   alternative navigation system. Most visual-based runway landing systems
   are typically focused on runway detection and localization while
   neglecting the issue of integrating the localization solution into
   flight control and guidance laws to become a complete real-time
   automatic landing system. This study addresses these problems by
   combining runway detection and localization methods, YOLOv8 and CNN
   (convolutional neural network) regression, to demonstrate the robustness
   of deep learning approaches. Moreover, a line detection method is
   employed to accurately align the UAV with the runway, effectively
   resolving issues related to runway contours. In the control phase, the
   guidance law and controller are designed to ensure the stable flight of
   the UAV. Based on a deep learning model framework, this study conducts
   experiments within the simulation environment, verifying system
   stability under various assumed conditions, thereby avoiding the risks
   associated with real-world testing. The simulation results demonstrate
   that the UAV can achieve automatic landing on 3-degree and 5-degree
   glide slopes, whether it is directly aligned with the runway or
   deviating from it, with trajectory tracking errors within 10 m.},

Abstract = {Distributed beamforming has emerged as a pivotal technology in modern

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The low detectability and low cost of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs)
   allow them to swarm near the radar network for effective jamming. The
   key to jamming is the reasonable task assignment and resource allocation
   of UAVs. However, the existing allocation model is somewhat ideal,
   weakly adaptive to the dynamic environment, and rarely considers
   frequency matching, which cannot suppress the frequency agile radar
   (FAR) network effectively. To solve these problems, a dynamic UAVs
   cooperative suppressive jamming method with joint task assignment and
   bandwidth allocation is proposed. To represent the matching relationship
   between UAVs and FARs, a system model of task assignment and bandwidth
   allocation is established, the problem is formulated as a dynamic mixed
   integer programming problem. Then, a suppressive jamming evaluation
   indicator is proposed, and the utility function is designed based on the
   quality of service framework to quantify the jamming effect of UAVs. To
   solve the combinational optimization problem, a two-step dynamic hybrid
   algorithm based on the Kriging model is proposed, which can obtain the
   task assignment and bandwidth allocation schemes of UAVs by consuming
   fewer computational resources in a dynamic environment. Simulation
   results show that the proposed method is effective in terms of jamming
   performance, computational resource saving and dynamic environment
   adaptability.},

Abstract = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and reconfigurable intelligent
   surfaces (RISs) have merged as important enabling technologies for
   localization coverage extension and localization accuracy improvement
   under signal blockage and malicious interference conditions. However,
   most existing works assume known locations of jammers, which is
   generally impractical in real-world networks. To overcome this
   challenge, we propose a novel RIS-enhanced wireless localization
   framework against malicious interference with the support of either
   narrowband or orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) pilot
   signals. A two-stage anti-jamming localization approach is developed to
   first estimate the unknown channel and signal information of the jammer
   and then localize the user's position by eliminating the jamming signal.
   More importantly, we utilize the full potential of RIS to improve
   localization accuracy by optimizing the phase shift profile during the
   iterative process. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the
   commendable performance of our proposed framework, which can not only
   mitigate the jamming effect but also achieve better localization
   accuracy, offering a good reference for future heterogeneous and complex

Title = {GNSS Threat Simulator for Urban Air Mobility Scenarios},
Journal = {AEROSPACE},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {The safety-critical functions of autonomous drones heavily rely on
   Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) information provided by Global
   Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSSs). This makes GNSS technology a
   critical element as the PNT solution can be affected by several threats,
   mostly in urban and suburban environments. In order to evaluate safe and
   reliable GNSS-based solutions in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) scenarios, a
   proper GNSS security impact simulator is needed. In this context, the
   present work details the design, implementation and testing of a GNSS
   Threat Simulator (GTS) capable of reproducing typical issues within a
   GNSS system in a UAM environment, such as satellite visibility (i.e.,
   the actual visibility condition of the receiver's antenna with respect
   to terrain and ground obstacle), multipath, electromagnetic
   interference, cyber threats (i.e., spoofing and jamming) and satellites
   failures. The GTS elaborates and modifies dual-frequency
   multi-constellation GNSS observables in order to inject the desired
   threats. The effectiveness of the proposed simulator has been
   demonstrated through both fast-time and real-time simulations, in which
   the GTS was used to validate a hybrid navigation unit installed on a
   drone operating in a representative urban scenario.},

Abstract = {Intelligent transportation systems, including autonomous vehicles,
   require precise and reliable navigation and positioning systems to
   ensure safety. However, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
   observations are degraded by signal interference, such as obstructions
   and reflections from high-rise buildings. Navigation methods struggle to
   effectively process GNSS outliers caused by multipath effects and
   non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception in urban environments under changing
   scenarios. To address this issue, this study proposes a robust factor
   graph optimization (FGO) approach based on a flexible strategy.
   Initially, a quality evaluation method utilizing the Mahalanobis
   distance of pseudorange residual test statistics is developed, enabling
   smooth and dynamic adjustment of the measurement fusion weights for each
   satellite. Furthermore, by integrating both satellite quantity and
   quality data, a flexible strategy is proposed that fully accounts for
   the differences in measurement quality and the reference values of each
   satellite across different scenarios. This integration with the
   navigation environment improves the robustness of the tightly coupled
   navigation system. Three vehicle-mounted experiments in urban canyon
   environments were conducted, and the results indicate that, compared to
   conventional methods, the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of horizontal
   positioning were reduced by 13.24\%, 26.06\%, and 33.92\%, respectively.
   The proposed method effectively mitigates the impact of GNSS outliers
   and enhances the reliability of GNSS-based navigation systems for
   applications such as autonomous vehicles, uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV),
   and urban transportation systems.},

Abstract = {Recently, the flying sensor systems have been given a careful interest
   to provide critical administrations and services in a fiasco territory.
   Since severe debacles require the trading of geo-referenced area-based
   data among the salvage group and additionally the people in question, an

Abstract = {This article presents a set of nondestructive test methodologies
   designed to evaluate and compare performance of the communication links
   used for control and telemetry of small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS)
   (drones) that are operating indoors and in subterranean environments.
   Such a set of standardized test methodologies does not yet exist. Indoor
   and subterranean operation requires sUAS to operate without global
   positioning system and often in a spatially constrained
   non-line-of-sight (NLOS) communication environment. Operating in
   constrained indoor environments puts additional constraints on the
   communication links and requires a set of tests to allow evaluation and
   comparison of different units in typical scenarios that will be
   encountered. Tests to measure and compare communication link performance
   and ability to pilot in tunnels and office type buildings with doors,
   walls, and other obstructions, as well as stairwells are described. The
   test methods consist of measuring and comparing the NLOS radio range
   between the sUAS and the ground control station or operator control unit
   (OCU), observing the sUAS behavior with partial or total communication
   failure. Near the edge of coverage, correlated packet loss can lead to
   difficulties in piloting. A methodology for evaluating video latency
   that is critical for remote piloting by camera only is presented.
   Finally, a test methodology for characterizing the effects of
   interference and jamming by waveforms such as Wi-Fi often encountered in
   buildings is described. These test methodologies described here extend
   standards developed for ground robots to three dimensions. The test
   methodologies described in this article are part of a multifaceted
   project that evaluates many essential elements of drone operation
   indoors. These include communication, navigation, collision tolerance,
   mapping, trust, and automation. The test methodologies are designed to
   be reproduced in user facilities.},

Abstract = {The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to
   disruption sources, such as signal jamming. This, in turn, can cause
   severe degradation or discontinuities of the GNSS-based position,
   navigation, and timing services. The availability of multi-frequency
   signals from multi-constellation GNSS systems, such as Galileo and
   GLONASS, along with the modernization of GPS with multi-frequency
   signals, has the potential to increase the immunity of GNSS-based
   navigation systems to signal jamming. Despite various studies completed
   on the utilization of multi-frequency and multi-constellation global
   navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals to resist receiver jamming,
   there is still an urge to further investigate this concern under
   different circumstances. This paper presents an experimental evaluation
   of the advantages of the employment of multi-frequency
   multi-constellation GNSS signals for better GNSS receivers' performance
   during signal jamming situations for high-dynamic platforms such as
   aircraft/drones. Additionally, the study examines the effects of both
   simulated and real jamming signals on all possible combinations of the
   GPS, Galileo, and GLONASS signal frequencies and constellations. Two
   airplane trajectory routes were built, and their corresponding RF
   signals were generated using the Spirent and Orolia GNSS signal
   simulators. The results indicated that the GPS multi-frequency-based
   solution maintains reliable positioning performance to some extent under
   low jamming scenarios. However, the combination of GPS, Galileo, and
   GLONASS signals proved its ability to provide a continuous and accurate
   positioning solution during both low and high jamming scenarios.},

Abstract = {Intentional interference in satellite navigation is becoming an
   increasing threat for modern systems relying on Global Navigation
   Satellite Systems (GNSS). In particular, critical applications such as
   aviation can be severely affected by un-detected and un-mitigated
   interference and therefore interference management solutions are crucial

   enclose interference detection, interference mitigation, interference
   classification, and interference localization. This paper offers a
   comprehensive survey of interference management methods developed in the
   last four decades by the research community. After reviewing the main
   concepts of GNSS-based navigation, the interference and interference
   management solutions are classified, with a particular focus on the two
   major threats in GNSS navigation, namely jamming and spoofing.
   Mathematical models, comparative tables for various interference
   management solutions, such as detection, localization, mitigation, and
   classification, as well as comparative numerical results based on
   several selected algorithms are also presented. We especially focus on
   algorithms relying on omni-directional antennas, which do not require

Title = {Target tracking strategy using deep deterministic policy gradient},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {95},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {To address the challenge of maintaining high robustness of target
   tracking in a 3D dynamic high-altitude scenario, this paper presents a
   method to formulate continuous strategic maneuvers for unmanned combat
   air vehicles (UCAVs) based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG).
   DDPG is an efficient reinforcement learning approach that helps UCAV
   perform a variety of navigation tasks in real-time in a dynamic and
   random electronic warfare environment, and therefore possesses clear
   advantages over other technologies. First, create a target tracking
   simulator, Tracker, in the cognitive electronic warfare framework, and
   conduct a theoretical analysis of maneuvering bias produced by
   environmental observational errors. Tracker can automatically correlate
   the maximum physical overload with UCAV's attitude angles and desired
   movement commands. Second, shape the agent's behavior rewards under the
   inspiration of vector-based navigation to ensure that the DDPG's output
   is reliable. Finally, a DRL-based navigation decision framework is
   employed to validate the simulation for target tracking tasks in
   different environments and bring excellent results. In terms of behavior
   assessment, the agile maneuvers mastered by the agent are dissected by
   time segmentation of high-quality trajectories. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The need to successfully navigate in the absence of GNSS has grown in
   recent years. In particular, light aircraft such as UAVs are growing in
   popularity for a variety of applications vulnerable to GPS denial. The
   research presented here develops a GPS-denied navigation scheme for
   light aircraft employing images formed from a synthetic aperture radar
   system. Past research has explored the utility of radar telemetry in
   GPS-denied systems. This research advances previous work by exploiting
   radar images to obtain range and cross-range position measurements.
   Images are formed using the Range-Doppler Algorithm, an efficient image
   formation algorithm ideal for the sometimes limited processing packages
   available to light aircraft. An inertial navigation and radar processing
   system is implemented using both real and simulated radar images to aid
   in estimating an aircraft's state in a GPS-denied environment. The
   results show that navigation in the absence of GPS using synthetic
   aperture radar is feasible with converging and bounded estimation
   errors.},

Abstract = {The knowledge of spatial distributions of physical quantities, such as
   radio-frequency (RF) interference, pollution, geomagnetic field
   magnitude, temperature, humidity, audio, and light intensity, will
   foster the development of new context-aware applications. For example,
   knowing the distribution of RF interference might significantly improve
   cognitive radio systems {[}1], {[}2]. Similarly, knowing the spatial
   variations of the geomagnetic field could support autonomous navigation
   of robots (including drones) in factories and/or hazardous scenarios
   {[}3]. Other examples are related to the estimation of temperature
   gradients, detection of sources of RF signals, or percentages of certain
   chemical components. As a result, people could get personalized
   health-related information based on their exposure to sources of risks
   (e.g., chemical or pollution). We refer to these spatial distributions
   of physical quantities as spatial fields. All of the aforementioned
   examples have in common that learning the spatial fields requires a
   large number of sensors (agents) surveying the area {[}4], {[}5].
   A common way to sense environmental variables is the deployment of
   dedicated wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which continues to stimulate
   fertile research activities in the scientific community. Typical WSN
   applications are oriented to sense specific physical quantities (e.g.,
   temperature) in well-defined areas {[}6], {[}7]. Unfortunately WSNs are
   generally characterized by significant constraints in terms of
   deployment cost, energy limitation, and the need for maintenance. These
   constraints prevent them from becoming scalable and therefore from being
   the ultimate solution for automated and distributed sensing of the
   physical world.
   The expected pervasive diffusion of Internet of Things (IoT) devices
   (fixed and mobile) opens up a unique opportunity for a wide and massive
   sensing and mapping (i.e., georeferencing of physical quantities). In
   fact, the IoT constitutes a paradigm where a multitude of heterogeneous
   devices is able to sense the environment, process data, and actuate,
   thus creating the necessary infrastructure for cyberphysical systems.
   This infrastructure galvanizes technologies such as smart grids, smart
   homes, smart cities, and intelligent transportation {[}8], {[}9].
   From the extensive variety of applications of the IoT, we are interested
   in those that will benefit from having a spatial coverage of a wide area
   due to a large number of agents navigating through it. For instance,
   this can be the case when devices are carried by people or autonomous
   agents (e.g., vehicles, robots, or drones) moving in outdoor-and
   indoor-populated environments like malls, stadiums, or crowded
   buildings. One can even imagine cities at large, if one considers much
   larger settings in size. Thanks to the widespread diffusion of IoT
   devices with heterogeneous sensors, the estimation of spatial physical
   fields is creating a new trend for next-generation sensor networks,
   referred to as mobile crowdsensing networks {[}10]-{[}13]. This is
   basically a zero-effort approach to automatically collect and process
   data. Recently, as an example, this concept has been proposed for
   zero-effort automatic mapping of environmental features using sensors
   already embedded in smartphones, such as magnetometers and Wi-Fi
   {[}14]-{[}17]. In such settings, the contribution of the agent to the
   sensing process is as simple as carrying the personal device in a pocket
   while the individual is moving around. Individuals are not even
   requested to be participatory, as the sensing process could run in the
   background during the normal operation of the device. In other words,
   agents are aware of the background sensing process, but they are not
   participatory in the sense that they are not requested to follow
   particular paths to make the learning process more effective. Thus, the
   sensing process is not an exclusive task, and it arises from the dynamic
   reality of humans or autonomous agents. The sensing process is a result
   of piggybacking on the capabilities of today's and future wireless
   personal devices. Including data generated by these devices will
   dramatically increase the amount of data for sensing and mapping
   purposes, with obvious benefits in terms of the resulting accuracy.
   In this context, the IoT is the technological enabler for crowdsensing
   and learning of spatial fields. Interestingly, IoT devices are, in
   general, able to communicate among themselves, either directly or
   through a fusion node that can potentially be in the cloud. Thanks to
   communication capabilities, empirical data gathered by mobile agents
   (the crowd) can be collected and processed by learning algorithms
   located in the cloud. These algorithms exploit the correspondence
   between the position and the value of the physical quantity measured in
   that position to estimate the spatial field. As a consequence,
   positioning and spatial field estimation are intimately intertwined, as
   will be illustrated in the ``Sensing and Positioning{''} section.
   Crowdsourcing-based learning methods rely on the experience gained by
   previous agents. In principle, it is possible that, with crowd-based
   learning, one can perform optimal information fusion {[}10]. On the
   other hand, moving from the well-controlled conditions of WSN scenarios,
   where nodes are deployed in ad hoc known locations, to crowdsensing
   settings, where agents move around in an uncontrolled manner, entails a
   number of issues that need to be addressed. The methods rely on sharing
   through cloud mechanisms {[}18], but they can be of practical relevance
   in IoT applications only if their computational and memory requirements
   do not grow with the amount of collected data. Therefore, novel
   methodologies for multisensor data fusion and information processing are
   needed. They should guarantee efficient statistical representation of
   spatial fields and a computational complexity that does not depend on
   the number of measurements. Further, the algorithms need to be robust
   against irregular positioning and measurement errors.},

Title = {A Miniaturized Multiband Antenna Array for Robust Navigation in Aerial
   Applications},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Satellite navigation is more and more important in a plethora of very
   different application fields, ranging from bank transactions to
   shipping, from autonomous driving to aerial applications, such as
   avionics as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Due to the
   increasing dependency on satellite navigation, the need for robust
   systems able to counteract unintentional or intentional interferences is
   growing. When considering interference-robust designs; however, the
   complexity increases. Top performance is obtained through the use of
   multi-antenna receivers capable of performing spatial nulling in the
   direction of the interference signals. In particular, mobile
   applications (aeronautics, UAVs, automotive) have a substantial interest
   in robust navigation, but they also have the strongest constraints on
   the weight and available places for installation, with the use of bigger
   and heavier systems posing a substantial problem. In order to overcome
   this limitation, the present work shows a miniaturized five element
   (4+1) antenna array, which operates at the L1/E1 band (with array
   capability), as well as at the L5/E5 band (as a single antenna). The
   proposed antenna array is able to fit into a 3.5-inch footprint, i.e.,
   is compliant with the most widespread footprints for single antennas.
   Moreover, it is capable of multiband operation and meets the
   requirements of dual-frequency multi-constellation (DFMC) systems.
   Thanks to its extreme miniaturization and its compliance with current
   airborne single antenna footprints, the presented antenna array is
   suitable for easy integration in future aerial platforms, while enabling
   robustness and enhancing interference mitigation techniques using
   multi-antenna processing.},

Abstract = {Autonomous systems are rapidly becoming an integrated part of the modern
   life. Safe and secure navigation and control of these systems present
   significant challenges in the presence of uncertainties, physical
   failures, and cyber attacks. In this paper, we formulate a navigation
   and control problem for autonomous systems using a multilevel control
   structure, in which the high-level reference commands are limited by a
   saturation function, whereas the low-level controller tracks the
   reference by compensating for disturbances and uncertainties. For this
   purpose, we consider a class of nested, uncertain,
   multiple-input-multiple-output systems subject to reference command
   saturation, possibly with nonminimum phase zeros. A multirate
   output-feedback L1 adaptive controller is developed as the low-level
   controller. The sampled-data (SD) design of this controller facilitates
   the direct implementation on digital computers, where the input/output
   signals are available at discrete time instances with different sampling
   rates. In addition, stealthy zero-dynamics attacks become detectable by
   considering a multirate SD formulation. Robust stability and performance
   of the overall closed-loop system with command saturation and multirate
   L1 adaptive control are analyzed. Simulation scenarios for navigation
   and control of a fixed-wing drone under failures/attacks are provided to
   validate the theoretical findings.},

Abstract = {In order to increase the robustness of the uplink for UAS(Unmanned
   Aerial System), we propose a jamming signal rejection algorithm. In the
   UAS datalink system, DSSS (direct sequence spread spectrum) is used to
   reduce the radio noise or jamming signal. In general, jamming signals
   below the spreading gain are recoverable but the signals beyond the
   spreading gain can not be recovered. In this paper, these jamming
   signals beyond spreading gain are detected using the threshold detector
   in the spectrum area then, generate the estimated signals from the sine
   wave generator. Finally, we obtain the desired signal to remove jamming
   signals from the received signals. The proposed scheme can eliminate
   jamming signals while minimizing the hardware complexity and the
   original signal loss.},
