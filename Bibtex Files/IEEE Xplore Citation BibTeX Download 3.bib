  abstract={With the maturity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, UAV plays an important role in communication due to its high mobility. In this paper, we study a dual-UAVs assisted communication system to combat both UAV eavesdropper and multiple eavesdroppers on the ground. Our goal is to maximize the minimum average secrecy rate among all ground users by jointly optimizing the UAV basestation trajectory, auxiliary interference UAV trajectory, transmit power control and user scheduling. To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and block coordinate descent (BCD) to make the problem approximate convex. Specifically, we consider a more complex scene with eavesdroppers on the ground and in the air, and we adapt the Rician fading channel model with small scale fading and large scale fading for air-to-ground communication, and the free space fading model for air-to-air communication. Compared with the single fading channel model, a more realistic situation is presented. The simulation results show joint design of dual-UAVs can significantly improve the average secrecy rate compared with the single UAV-Aided scheme, and when only ideal line of sight (LoS) fading is considered, the secrecy rate is slightly higher than our proposed scheme. However, if the trajectory of the UAVs considering only LoS is put into our proposed model, the result will be slightly lower than our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract={To strengthen tracking in dynamic flight maneuvers the miniaturized real-time Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver GALileo ANTenna (GALANT), developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), has been equipped with a robust vector tracking algorithm. To harden the receiver the algorithm used on the platform excludes Non-Line-Of-Sight signals by exploiting spatial information gained by the 2×2 antenna array and its processing. This contribution focuses on the planning, execution and evaluation of the experimental validation of the receiver and its tracking algorithm by conduction of open field flight test in the rural area near Munich. The developed system was fitted as payload to a compact hexacopter and the potential benefits in signal tracking are investigated, while the algorithm relies on GNSS information only and uses no other sensor data input such as Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) or compass. The receiver has been developed to be resilient to intentional and unintentional interference from diverse origins based on spatial suppression of jamming sources, which has been proven in previous tests. Performing these techniques also suppresses satellite signals impinging from the direction of the interference source, which need to be recovered. To test the performance of the implemented vector tracking algorithm with respect to the signal recovery, the receiver is exposed to a jamming source on ground while changing the constellation.},

  pages={16433-16447},
  abstract={To improve the robustness and reliability of multi-sensor navigation and reduce the uncertainties and complexity of sensor management in challenging environment, a resilient interactive sensor-independent-update (ISIU) method is proposed. Inspired by the interactive cooperation theory, the contributions can be divided into two aspects. Firstly the priority of trust of navigation sensors is introduced into the information fusion in the form of transition probability matrix defined by Markov chain. Secondly every observable sensor is integrated with the propagated system in an elemental filter with sensor-independent-update structure. The multi-sensor integration is implemented in state estimation domain enhanced by interactive information fusion rather than in measurement domain implemented in traditional filter method. The overall estimation is determined by the weighted sum of average from every filter estimate. This weight of every model is dynamic updated by the prior transition information and posterior model likelihood. The same independent structure is also applied to adopt new available sensor to realize plug-and-play navigation. The kinematic vehicle experiment in sub-urban and urban canyon environment verified the superiority of the proposed method. The ISIU method shows better accuracy and reliability compared to classical Kalman filters. The introduction of priority of sensors and decoupled measurement update process make it robust and insensitive to sensor measurement noise and outliers. The interactive sensor-independent-update structure has the natural function of fault detection and exclusion without additional operations. The effect of dynamic sensor selection is achieved in this processing. The proposed ISIU method is pretty suitable for resilient navigation in challenging environments.},

  abstract={Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have merged as important enabling technologies for localization coverage extension and localization accuracy improvement under signal blockage and malicious interference conditions. However, most existing works assume known locations of jammers, which is generally impractical in real-world networks. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel RIS-enhanced wireless localization framework against malicious interference with the support of either narrowband or orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) pilot signals. A two-stage anti-jamming localization approach is developed to first estimate the unknown channel and signal information of the jammer and then localize the user’s position by eliminating the jamming signal. More importantly, we utilize the full potential of RIS to improve localization accuracy by optimizing the phase shift profile during the iterative process. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the commendable performance of our proposed framework, which can not only mitigate the jamming effect but also achieve better localization accuracy, offering a good reference for future heterogeneous and complex wireless networks.},

The topicality of the topic is primarily due to the conflict in Ukraine, where drones have been used since the beginning of the conflict. The article summarizes the various possibilities of using these means in reconnaissance or combat activities, as well as the different types of these means. Equipment developed for military use is used, but there are still conversions of originally purely civilian equipment for military use. However, all the means used have a common technical problem, and that is determining the location, which is crucial for the use of drones. For professional drones, it is an essential part of guidance using navigation systems. These positioning systems can be interfered with in various ways.

  title={Robust Communication-Aware Jamming Detection and Avoidance for UAS Swarms}, 
  year={2025},

  pages={200431-200445},
  abstract={Unmanned autonomous system (UAS) swarms empower groups of robotic agents (such as drones) to collectively accomplish complex missions by navigating intricate environments, but face significant challenges when operating in contested areas with electromagnetic jamming that disrupts inter-agent communication. This paper introduces an innovative hierarchical control strategy that enables a drone swarm to traverse complex terrains, including regions compromised by electromagnetic jamming intended to disrupt communications. The swarm is initially unaware of the existence or location of these jamming areas, making autonomous detection and avoidance critical for mission success. The proposed strategy synergistically combines communication-aware formation control, particle swarm optimization (PSO) for reactive navigation, and a global path planner for deadlock resolution to ensure the swarm maintains optimal communication quality and mission continuity. A gradient controller maintains the desired swarm formation by maximizing communication quality among agents, while a PSO-based movement controller navigates toward a destination, avoiding newly discovered jamming areas. To address potential deadlocks, a path planning algorithm is invoked to generate a globally optimal route. The framework operates without prior knowledge of jamming locations, learning threat positions through real-time environmental interaction. A comparative analysis of various path planning algorithms, including A*, Greedy Best-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra’s algorithm, Jump Point Search, and Theta*, is presented through simulation. The results demonstrate that A* provides optimal performance for our integrated framework, facilitating efficient and robust navigation for the UAS swarms, while maintaining high communication quality among individual drones.

  abstract={With the increasing use of drones for commercial, industrial, and military applications, global positioning system (GPS)-based navigation is the most critical tool for positioning accuracy and autonomous decision-making. GPS spoofing attacks, however, are a realistic threat with the potential to mislead drones in estimating incorrect positions, thus inducing navigation failures, illegal landings, and security intrusions. This study experimented with the vulnerability of drones to GPS spoofing attacks and examined various mitigation and detection strategies. A laboratory-controlled setup with hardware equipment, such as GPS receivers, software radio (SDRs), and machine learning techniques, was used for anomaly detection. The Drone Flight Path Controller interface was used for the real-time observation and evasion of GPS spoofing attacks. The resultant system accurately identified spoofed signals with 97% detection performance and initiated a return-to-home (RTH) mode with an average of 2.3 seconds of detection latency. The outcomes emphasize the need to integrate high-level security solutions to protect drones against GPS-based cyberattacks, along with enabling safe and reliable autonomous operation.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={529-534},
  abstract={In this paper, the optimization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization under jamming attacks is studied. In the considered network, a base station (BS) collaborates with an active UAV to localize a target UAV. During this positioning process, a jamming UAV transmits discontinuous signals to passive UAVs to interfere the distance information measurement. To localize the target UAV under jamming attacks, the BS jointly use two localization methods: 1) generative adversarial network (GAN)-based positioning method and 2) time difference of arrival (TDOA)-based positioning method. Since GAN-based positioning method cannot defense in a strong jamming signal while TDOA-based positioning method may consume more energy and sacrifice localization accuracy, the BS must select an appropriate positioning method (GAN-based or TDOA-based methods) and four distance measurement information of passive UAVs to estimate the position of the target UAV. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the positioning error between the estimated and the ground truth positions of the target UAV while considering jamming attacks and the trajectory of passive UAVs. To solve this problem, we propose a mixture Gaussian distribution model-based collaborative reinforcement learning (RL) method which enables the active UAV to determine its transmit power and trajectory, and enables the BS to select the most appropriate subsets of distance measurement information and the optimal positioning method according to the movement of passive UAVs and the unknown jamming attack pattern of the jamming UAV. Simulation results show the proposed method can reduce the positioning error of the target UAV by up to 36.5% compared to the method that does not consider the GAN-based positioning method.},

  abstract={A radar network solution to detect drones is presented that consists of low-cost low-size dual-channel moving receivers, which can be deployed on UASs and operate within the coverage of an existing cooperative or non-cooperative monostatic staring radar. The receivers exploit the use of a dual-channel design and therefore use a reference and a surveillance channel to operate coherently without the requirement of a shared synchronisation reference signal between the network nodes, which is one of the key limitations of other traditional multistatic radar network solutions. Drone detection and parameter estimation is achieved by fusing the information collected at the network receivers and rely on accurate Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) information. In this paper, we investigate the effects of PNT errors on estimation performance for such a radar network.},

Our objective is to minimize the age of information (AoI) of the sensory data by jointly optimizing the scheduling, transmit beamforming, trajectory, and transmit power of the UAV, while considering the communication quality constraints and physical constraints. To solve the optimization problem in a low-complexity manner, we first derive a closed-form solution for the transmit beamforming. Then, we decompose the remaining problem into two subproblems: one focuses on maximizing the total amount of the target sensing time, while the other aims to minimize the total amount of the sensing task completion time. For the former subproblem, we propose a low-complexity chain-based algorithm. For the latter subproblem, we utilize the Lagrange dual method and successive convex approximation technique. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can achieve a smaller average AoI with a low complexity compared to benchmark schemes.},

  abstract={With the advantages of high mobility and flexible deployment, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) combines with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising technology. When dynamic Terminal Users (TUs) offload tasks to UAVs, eavesdroppers may eavesdrop on the channel information. The offloading decisions, trajectory plannings of UAVs and resource allocation with the objective of high-capacity secure communication is a challenging problem. In this paper, we design a multi-UAVs MEC system, where the original region is divided into several sub-regions and TUs offload tasks to UAVs which provide computing services for these TUs. Meanwhile, A joint optimization problem of offloading decision, resource allocation and trajectory planning is formulated, where TUs move with the Gauss-Markov random model. In addition, the Base Station (BS) emits jamming signals to evade the eavesdropping of offloading information from eavesdroppers. The goal of the optimization problem is to maximize the TUs’ minimum secure calculation capacity, and a Joint Dynamic Programming and Bidding (JDPB) algorithm is proposed to solve it. The Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) and Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) algorithms are used to handle the resource allocation and trajectory planning problems, and the bidding method is used to address the task offloading decision problem. Simulation results show that JDPB has better performance and better robustness under different parameter settings than other schemes.},

  year={2025},
  volume={25},

  pages={29296-29309},
  abstract={Intelligent transportation systems, including autonomous vehicles, require precise and reliable navigation and positioning systems to ensure safety. However, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations are degraded by signal interference, such as obstructions and reflections from high-rise buildings. Navigation methods struggle to effectively process GNSS outliers caused by multipath effects and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) reception in urban environments under changing scenarios. To address this issue, this study proposes a robust factor graph optimization (FGO) approach based on a flexible strategy. Initially, a quality evaluation method utilizing the Mahalanobis distance of pseudorange residual test statistics is developed, enabling smooth and dynamic adjustment of the measurement fusion weights for each satellite. Furthermore, by integrating both satellite quantity and quality data, a flexible strategy is proposed that fully accounts for the differences in measurement quality and the reference values of each satellite across different scenarios. This integration with the navigation environment improves the robustness of the tightly coupled navigation system. Three vehicle-mounted experiments in urban canyon environments were conducted, and the results indicate that, compared to conventional methods, the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of horizontal positioning were reduced by 13.24%, 26.06%, and 33.92%, respectively. The proposed method effectively mitigates the impact of GNSS outliers and enhances the reliability of GNSS-based navigation systems for applications such as autonomous vehicles, uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), and urban transportation systems.},

  abstract={There has been substantial growth in the UAV market along with an expansion in their applications. However, the successful execution of a UAV mission is very often dependent on the use of a GNSS. Unfortunately, the vulnerability of GNSS signals, due to their lack of encryption and authentication, poses a significant cybersecurity issue. This vulnerability makes various attacks, particularly the “GNSS spoofing attack,” and “GNSS jamming attack” easily executable. Generally speaking, during this attack, the drone is manipulated into altering its path, usually resulting in an immediate forced landing or crash. As far as we know, we are the first to propose a lightweight-solution that enable a drone to autonomously rescue itself, assuming it is under GNSS attack and the GNSS is no longer available, and return safely to its initial takeoff position, thereby preventing any potential crashes. During the flight, wind plays a critical role as it can instantaneously alter the drone's position. To solve this problem, we have devised a highly effective 2-phases solution: (i) Forward Phase, for monitoring and recording the forward journey, and (ii) Backward Phase, that generates a backward route, based on the Forward Phase and wind presence. The final solution ensures strong performance in consistently returning the drone to the original position, even in wind situations, while maintaining a very fast computation time.},

  abstract={Recent advancements in drone technology have shown that commercial off-the-shelf Micro Aerial Drones are more effective than large-sized drones for performing flight missions in narrow environments, such as swarming, indoor navigation, and inspection of hazardous locations. Due to their deployments in many civilian and military applications, safe and reliable communication of these drones throughout the mission is critical. The Crazyflie ecosystem is one of the most popular Micro Aerial Drones and has the potential to be deployed worldwide. In this paper, we empirically investigate two interference attacks against the Crazy Real Time Protocol (CRTP) implemented within the Crazyflie drones. In particular, we explore the feasibility of experimenting two attack vectors that can disrupt an ongoing flight mission: the jamming attack, and the hijacking attack. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of such attacks in both autonomous and non-autonomous flight modes on a Crazyflie 2.1 drone. Finally, we suggest potential shielding strategies that guarantee a safe and secure flight mission. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work investigating jamming and hijacking attacks against Micro Aerial Drones, both in autonomous and non-autonomous modes.},

  abstract={This paper investigates the green and secure communications of multi-UAV NOMA systems. A joint energy transfer and artificial noise (ETAN) scheme is proposed to enhance the endurance and secrecy performance of the system. In particular, communication can be divided into two phases during each time frame. In the first phase, the multi-UAV system harvests energy from a power beacon. In the second phase, UAVs perform NOMA to transmit confidential messages uplink to a base station in the presence of eavesdropping UAVs. Simultaneously, to safeguard the multi-UAV system, the power beacon transmits artificial noise to degrade the eavesdropping channel. The closed-form expressions of connection outage probability (COP), secrecy outage probability (SOP) and effective secrecy throughput (EST) of the system are derived to evaluate the system performance. The asymptotic analysis of SOP and EST is also performed for further insights. Numerical results are presented to validate the correctness of theoretical derivations and the superiority of the proposed scheme. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the secrecy diversity order of the proposed scheme is determined by the jamming channel. When the number of UAVs increases, the time of energy harvesting should be appropriately extended. Moreover, substantial improvement to the system can be achieved by UAV pairing.},

  abstract={In this article, a resilient path planning scheme is proposed to navigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to its planned (nominal) destination with minimum energy consumption in the presence of a strategic attacker. The UAV is equipped with the following two sensors: 1) a GPS sensor, which is vulnerable to spoofing attacks; 2) a well-functioning ultrawideband (UWB) sensor, which is possible to be deceived. It is shown that a covert attacker can significantly deviate the UAV's path without being detected by the UWB sensor by simultaneously corrupting the GPS signals and forging control inputs. The prerequisite for the attack occurrence is first discussed. Based on this prerequisite, an optimal attack scheme is proposed, which maximizes the deviation between the nominal destination and the real one. Correspondingly, an energy-efficient and resilient navigation scheme based on Pontryagin's maximum principle is formulated, which suppresses the above covert attacker effectively. Essentially, this problem can be seen as a Stackelberg game between a resilient path planner (defender) and a covert attacker. The effectiveness of our theoretical results is illustrated via two simulation examples.},

  abstract={Real-world performance evaluation of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) requires a considerable amount of time and resources. It is challenging to evaluate and make frequent changes to optimize UAV performance practically. Furthermore, some cyber-attack resistance evaluation tests for UAV networks, like jamming, are illegal to perform in most countries. Simulators are software that enable us to evaluate UAV performance without real-world practical implementation. Simulations make it possible to create, implement, and test scenarios virtually on a computer.

  abstract={In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation, achieving high positioning accuracy is crucial but can be hindered by dynamic environmental uncertainties. This paper introduces DeepCovPG, a novel framework that leverages deep learning and Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology to enhance positioning precision significantly. At its core, DeepCovPG incorporates a novel neural network architecture, combining Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, to refine UWB range data by noise reduction and dynamic covariance prediction. This approach integrates a dynamic covariance model within the pose graph optimization process, diverges from conventional static uncertainty approaches, enhancing adaptability to environmental shifts and measurement errors. Tested across various settings, including indoor spaces and urban landscapes, DeepCovPG demonstrated a significant 51% reduction in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and substantial Mean Absolute Error (MAE) improvements over traditional methods, proving its effectiveness in tackling signal interference and navigational challenges for reliable UAV positioning.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) show significant potential in enhancing communication services within the mobile edge computing (MEC) system by taking their advantages on the flexible mobility and reliable line-of-sight links. However, in the scenarios with multiple UAV-MECs (UMs) operating concurrently, potential conflicts in their trajectories need to be mitigated. Thus, the 3-D trajectory needs to be properly designed in a highly reliable manner. Besides, such an infrastructure-free communication paradigm also exposes a potential risk of misuse by malicious parties, which allows them to eavesdrop on private communications, posing a threat to the security and privacy. Therefore, we consider a multi-UAV-assisted MEC communication system, where a UAV maliciously eavesdrops on the data transmission from the user devices (UDs) while a jammer is deployed on the ground to interfere with the eavesdropping channel. In specific, our objective is to minimize the energy consumption and latency while incorporating fairness metrics by optimizing the 3-D trajectories of UMs, transmission power of UDs, and the offloading strategies under the constraints of ensuring communication security and load fairness. Given the complexity of this mixed-integer nonconvex programming problem, we decompose the formulated problem into three subproblems. Specifically, at each time slot, we optimize the transmit power and offloading strategies using theoretical derivation and mathematical analysis, respectively. Additionally, a multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) algorithm is employed to optimize the trajectories of UMs. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed joint optimization algorithm successfully minimizes the system energy consumption and delay as compared to benchmarking schemes.},

  abstract={Now a days, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been exploited in numerous civil and military aspects such as disaster management and border monitoring. Although most of these UAVs are equipped with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) / Inertial Navigation System (INS) reliable integrated system for localization proposes, they are susceptible to lose their GNSS signals under some environmental and artificial challenging circumstances such as, flying in urban areas, jamming, and spoofing. In such complicated scenarios, the navigation solution will degrade rapidly due to the accumulated INS drift errors. Although various aiding sensors such as cameras, and radar are employed to mitigate the INS drift errors, their estimated positioning accuracy is still affected by some factors. This paper presents a nested optimal filter approach (G-H filter, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)) for UAVs in GNSS denied environment, to enhance the estimated positioning accuracy by integrating the Radar Odometry (RO)/INS/MAG to sustain a reliable navigation solution during GNSS outage. First, the UAV relative velocity is calculated based on image processing approach from the radar range doppler map, then the G-H filter is deployed to improve the accuracy of the vehicle estimated forward velocities based on the vehicle dynamic characteristics to reduce the effect of unrealistic velocity estimate from the radar. These improved velocities are then fused with the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), magnetometer, and barometer via EKF to mitigate the positioning RMS errors during the GNSS signals outages. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed system's ability to notably enhance the 3D positioning accuracy during the GNSS signal outage by more than 99% when compared to a stand-alone IMU dead reckoning solution.},

  abstract={In the 5G Advanced and 6G era, wireless communication systems face security challenges, notably adversarial interference from unknown jammers in multi-user scenarios. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) present a cost-effective solution due to their low power consumption and easy deployment. Existing RIS techniques typically address simple jamming scenarios with a single static jammer, focusing on a single objective. This study introduces a multi-objective optimization approach deploying UAV-mounted RIS to counter jamming threats in wireless communications within a densely populated smart city environment. The proposed solution aims to safeguard essential services from potential disruptions caused by malicious jamming attacks during public events. We employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a lightweight Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) technique, to concurrently optimize the trajectory of UAV and RIS passive beamforming to address computational complexity. The objectives include maximizing the average sum rate and minimizing energy consumption. Our experiments highlight the efficacy of the PPO-based strategy, demonstrating significant improvements in average sum rates and energy efficiency amid numerous mobile devices and moving jammers. Importantly, our proposed system model outperforms a baseline from related works in maximizing the sum rate and minimizing overall energy consumption.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted growing interest in wireless communications due to their several superiorities, such as highly controllable mobility, favorable communication links with the ground, on-demand deployment, and low cost. This paper investigates a UAV-ground communication system, where a UAV is dispatched to send classified information to a legitimate user in the presence of an eavesdropper on the ground while simultaneously avoiding flying over the no-fly zones (NFZs). We aim to maximize the average secrecy rate of the system by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and transmit power over a given flight period under the practical constraints on the UAV's maximum speed, the initial and final locations, avoidance of NFZs, as well as the transmit power. Although the existing works have studied a similar secrecy rate maximization problem, they all rely on general-purpose solvers, which leads to considerably high computational complexity. To address this issue, we propose an efficient algorithm by applying the techniques of alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) to obtain a suboptimal solution and utilizing the alternating directional method of multipliers (ADMM) under the SCA framework to realize low-complex implementation. The simulation results demonstrate the superior computational efficiency of our proposed algorithm and show the impact of NFZs on the system.},

  abstract={This research addresses the challenge in capturing rogue uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) strategies based on communication and navigation jamming technology in the absence of observable UAV communication performance parameters. The jamming involves remote communication suppressing (RCS) power control, as well as navigation suppressing (NS) and navigation deception (ND) combination, hence named as the diverse Hybrid jamming (DHJ) strategy. Firstly, we construct the DHJ model, which analyzes the dynamic impact mechanism of DHJ on UAV flight control systems based on common control protocols. Subsequently, we introduce the concept of the Situation Estimation Ring (SER) to overcome reward-driven deficiencies arising from incomplete observation and optimize features of the state space, which essentially considers the flight status feedback mechanism of the UAV to DHJ attacks and will be used to construct the DHJ Markov Decision Process (DHJ-MDP) mathematical framework. Then, the DHJ attack process against UAV is formulated as a game framework, where the counter-UAV system (CUS) generates DHJ strategy solely based on spatial positional states to deceive and capture the UAV, and the UAV adopts flight control strategies to evade jamming based on communication quality and navigation positioning information. Finally, the analysis of Nash equilibrium (NE) properties explain that the SER-based dynamic spatial positioning of UAV can be used for CUS to derive DHJ equilibrium strategies, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for solving these strategies using knowledge-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, with the algorithm’s complexity also being proven. Simulation and comparison experiments demonstrate that the solved DHJ strategy effectively drives UAV toward deceptive destinations under incomplete observation states, achieve the ‘lure the enemy in deep’ effect and the proposed SER-base algorithms enhances algorithm’s convergence speed.},

  abstract={Driven by the practicality of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), we consider a dual-UAV based non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scenario, which consists of one communication UAV for services and one jamming UAV against eavesdropping. The goal is to maximize the secrecy energy efficiency through the successive convex approximation based communication resource, UAV trajectory, and artificial noise optimization. Considering the probabilistic constraint of outage probability from imperfect channel state information, we transform it to a non-probabilistic problem by Markov inequality and Marcum  $Q$ -function, then the problem is decomposed into three subproblems. We apply matching-swapping method to assign subchannel in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) UAV networks before the joint process, then convert the power optimization problem to a standard convex optimization form by upper bound of the concave function. The communication UAV trajectory is studied under the constraints of flying energy consumption, maximum speed, and flying altitude. To track this NP-hard problem, Taylor expansion and various slack variables sets are introduced to transform the non-convex problem to convex one. For the artificial noise optimization problem, we use the lower bound to replace the convex term turning it into an easy-to-solve convex optimization problem. In the end, simulations results reveal that: 1) The reasonable jamming scheme can improve the secrecy energy efficiency of the NOMA UAV networks, even if it can cause interference for legitimate users; 2) UAV will fly to a place where the performance gain from users is high when flying energy consumption permits.},

  abstract={This work presents a three-dimensional control algorithm using reinforcement learning to guide an attacking hunter drone capable of performing a global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) repeater attack on the GNSS receiver of a target invader drone. Considering the mission and movement requirements of the hunter drone, a Q-learning algorithm was developed, for which the table with the possible transitions of the states and actions is obtained by the actions that the vehicle can take considering directions and the respective consequences of each action. The learning capability of the proposed algorithm arises from the trial and error by an agent. The penalty calculation is based on the error of the invader position to the hunter's desired position of the attacked drone. The developed algorithm is tested using a software-in-the-loop (SITL) implementation, which is based on the Ardupilot platform. SITL simulations are performed in a developed testbed to emulate operational scenarios, where an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is hijacked and then controlled by an attacking UAV until it reaches the final position desired by the hunter, usually a secure area where the vehicle can be captured without being destroyed. Results, including error metrics and action time, are discussed for different mission scenarios.},

  abstract={Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) face significant security risks from jamming attacks, which can compromise network functionality. Traditional detection methods often fall short against AI-powered jamming that dynamically adapts its behavior, while contemporary Machine Learning (ML) approaches frequently require extensive feature engineering and struggle to capture temporal patterns in attack signatures. The vulnerability extends to 5G networks employing Time Division Duplex (TDD) or Frequency Division Duplex (FDD), where service quality can deteriorate under deliberate interference. We introduce a novel U-shaped transformer architecture that leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to refine feature representations for improved wireless security. The training process is regularized by incorporating output entropy into the loss function, inspired by the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm in Reinforcement Learning (RL), to enhance robustness against jamming attacks. The architecture employs a modified transformer encoder tailored for wireless signal features, including Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), together with a custom positional encoding mechanism that captures the inherent periodicity of wireless signals for improved temporal modeling. To further optimize training, we propose a batch size scheduler and apply chunking techniques to accelerate convergence on time-series data, achieving up to a tenfold improvement in training speed within our U-shaped encoder–decoder transformer. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed entropy-based framework, achieving detection rates of 89.46% in Line-of-Sight (LoS) and 85.06% in Non-Line-of Sight (NLoS), with F1-scores up to 0.90 and Area under the Curve (AUC) values of 0.97 and 0.92 respectively, underscoring the model’s balanced performance across key evaluation metrics. The method significantly outperforms existing solutions, surpassing XGBoost (XGB) by approximately 4.5% and other Deep Learning (DL) approaches by more than 2%.},

  abstract={To realize the defense task of precise directional drive off of unmanned combat system in the target area, an anti-unmanned directional drive-off method under SINS(Strapdown Inertial Navigation System)/GPS(Global Positioning System) integrated navigation mode is proposed in this paper, which is suitable for the security defense of important places, urban public security protection and anti-terrorism and stability maintenance in sensitive areas. Firstly, this paper constructs a seven dimensional SINS/GPS integrated navigation model of unmanned combat system including horizontal position, velocity and attitude, and uses discrete Kalman filter for data fusion; Then, combined with the coupling relationship between various state parameters of SINS/GPS integrated navigation, the controllability and stability of false satellite signal acting on the position output of integrated navigation are analyzed, and then the feasibility of satellite navigation spoofing under SINS/GPS integrated navigation mode is deduced; Finally, the false satellite signal is designed and constructed to make the position estimation of SINS/GPS Integrated Navigation drive away accurately. The simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness and correctness of the anti-unmanned directional drive-off method under the integrated navigation mode. Note to Practitioners—This work is motivated by the need for the defense task of precise directional drive off of unmanned combat system in the target area. Most unmanned combat platforms adopt the integrated navigation mode with satellite navigation system as an auxiliary means. It can be challenging for researchers and practitioners to drive off the unmanned combat system which adopt the integrated navigation mode in the target area by the existing spoofing methods. Therefore, this paper presents an accurate directional displacement method against unmanned under the SINS/GPS integrated navigation mode and the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by UAV spoofing simulation and test. This paper provides researchers and practitioners with comprehensive reference sources in anti-Unmanned directional drive-off method under integrated navigation mode, which can help them develop suitable solutions to drive off the unmanned combat system which adopt the integrated navigation mode in the target area.},

Considering the computation capability and information security in maritime transportation systems, this work proposes a double-edge secure offloading scheme, where both base-station (BS) and satellites provide secure mobile-edge computing services for delay-sensitive applications. Specifically, maritime mobile users may offload their computation tasks adaptively to the BS or satellites securely relayed by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). To minimize offloading delay, we formulate an optimization problem to allocate the transmit power cooperatively via UAVs’ trajectory optimization. Moreover, jamming UAVs are deployed to protect the offloading process. For such a nonconvex optimization problem, two iterative algorithms are proposed to determine the transmit power and design the UAVs’ trajectories. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of offloading delay.},

  abstract={The downlink communications are vulnerable to intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jamming attack which can learn the optimal attack strategy in complex communication environments. In this paper, we propose an anti-intelligent UAV jamming strategy, in which the mobile users can learn the optimal defense strategy to prevent jamming. Specifically, the UAV jammer acts as a leader and the users act as followers. The problem is formulated as a stackelberg dynamic game, which includes the leader sub-game and the followers sub-game. As the UAV jammer is only aware of the incomplete channel state information (CSI) of the users, we model the leader sub-game as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). The optimal jamming trajectory is obtained via deep recurrent Q-networks (DRQN) in the three-dimension space. For the followers sub-game, we use the Markov decision process (MDP) to model it. Then the optimal communication trajectory can be learned via deep Q-networks (DQN) in the two-dimension space. We prove the existence of the stackelberg equilibrium. The simulations show that the proposed strategy outperforms the benchmark strategies.},

  abstract={In this paper, a machine learning (ML) approach is proposed to detect and classify jamming attacks against orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers with applications to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Using software-defined radio (SDR), four types of jamming attacks; namely, barrage, protocol-aware, single-tone, and successive-pulse are launched and investigated. Each type is qualitatively evaluated considering jamming range, launch complexity, and attack severity. Then, a systematic testing procedure is established by placing an SDR in the vicinity of a UAV (i.e., drone) to extract radiometric features before and after a jamming attack is launched. Numeric features that include signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), energy threshold, and key OFDM parameters are used to develop a feature-based classification model via conventional ML algorithms. Furthermore, spectrogram images collected following the same testing procedure are exploited to build a spectrogram-based classification model via state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms (i.e., convolutional neural networks). The performance of both types of algorithms is analyzed quantitatively with metrics including detection and false alarm rates. Results show that the spectrogram-based model classifies jamming with an accuracy of 99.79% and a false-alarm of 0.03%, in comparison to 92.20% and 1.35%, respectively, with the feature-based counterpart.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication is a significant technology in 6G communication. In order to cope with the dynamic trajectory optimization problem of the air-ground network, the interaction between entities is modeled as a Markov game firstly. Then, the model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is adopted to optimize individual decision-making. This enables agents to learn the mobile patterns of others, so as to optimize their own mobile strategy. However, there are some common issues when executing the benchmark MARL algorithms, such as biased estimation and local optimum. To solve these problems, an enhanced multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is proposed with policy clipping and average evaluation to guarantee the fast convergence and accurate estimation. Simulations demonstrate that this method produces superior convergence than the benchmark algorithms. It allows the UAV base station, ground users and the aerial jammer to adopt the optimal mobile strategies to achieve their respective maximum cumulative rewards. In addition, the stable strategies of agents constitute the approximate Nash equilibrium for the UAV-assisted communication Markov Game.},

  abstract={Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) provides reliable positioning across the globe. However, GNSS is vulnerable to deliberate interference problem like spoofing, which can cause fake navigation. This article proposes navigation in a GNSS spoofing environment by taking the received power, correlation distortion function, and pseudorange measurement observation space into account. In the proposed approach, both actual and interference measurements are considered a set. Machine learning screens the authentic measurements from the accessible set using parameters such as received power and correlation function distortion. To maintain the track and navigate the GNSS’s time-varying kinematics, we used a combination of the gating technique within the Kalman filter framework and logic-based track management. The machine learning classifiers like support vector machines (SVMs), neural networks (NNs), ensemble, nearest neighbor, and decision trees are explored, and we observe that linear SVM and NN provide a test accuracy of 98.20%. A time-varying position-pull off strategy is considered, and the metrics like position RMSE and track failure are compared with the conventional M-best algorithm. The results show that for four authentic measurements and spoof injections, there are only a few track failures. In contrast, even with an increase in spoof injections, track failures are zero in the case of six authentic measurements.},

  year={2024},

  pages={131-146},
  abstract={Despite the robust security features inherent in the 5G framework, attackers will still discover ways to disrupt 5G unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations and decrease UAV control communication performance in Air-to-Ground (A2G) links. Operating under the assumption that the 5G UAV communications infrastructure will never be entirely secure, we propose Deep Attention Recognition (DAtR) as a solution to identify attacks based on a small deep network embedded in authenticated UAVs. Our proposed solution uses two observable parameters: the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to recognize attacks under Line-of-Sight (LoS), Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), and a probabilistic combination of the two conditions. Several attackers are located in random positions in the tested scenarios, while their power varies between simulations. Moreover, terrestrial users are included in the network to impose additional complexity on attack detection. Additionally to the application and deep network architecture, our work innovates by mixing both observable parameters inside DAtR and adding two new pre-processing and post-processing techniques embedded in the deep network results to improve accuracy. We compare several performance parameters in our proposed Deep Network. For example, the impact of Long Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) and Attention layers in terms of their overall accuracy, the window size effect, and test the accuracy when only partial data is available in the training process. Finally, we benchmark our deep network with six widely used classifiers regarding classification accuracy. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) outperforms all other algorithms in the deep network, for instance, the three top scoring algorithms: Random Forest (RF), CatBoost (CAT), and XGB obtain mean accuracy of 83.24 %, 85.60 %, and 86.33% in LoS conditions, respectively. When compared to XGB, our algorithm improves accuracy by more than 4% in the LoS condition (90.80% with Method 2) and by around 3% in the short-distance NLoS condition (83.07% with Method 1).},

  abstract={There has been a recent increase in the studies on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology within unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In our paper, we propose a UAV base station (BS) localization method under aerial global positioning system (GPS) jammed environments, where the UAV-BS simultaneously provides communication service to user equipments (UEs) on ground. Unaffected UEs are utilized as reference anchor nodes to position UAV-BS to a near optimal location. Studying UAV deployment in environments where GPS access in unavailable is crucial due to the susceptibility of UAVs to GPS jamming, which poses a potential risk of inaccuracy for ISAC systems. We jointly optimize UAV-BS communication performance and localization accuracy in terms of transmission power, root mean square error (RMSE), and position dilution of precision (PDOP). Further, we introduce three different algorithms to select the optimal set of reference nodes for accurate UAV-BS localization. Nodes are selected based on relative UE positions and different geometric configurations they form. Simulation is conducted for different UE distribution scenarios and results confirm that our proposed scheme can optimize the communication power and localization performance of UAV-BS under different PDOP constraints.},

  abstract={A multi-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-aided secure communication network is studied, where multiple information UAVs carrying temporary aerial base stations transmit confidential information to multiple authorized receivers (ARs), and a jammer UAV is employed to send artificial noise to multiple unauthorized receivers (URs) for mitigating information leakage. Some practical constrains including the inter-UAV interference among the information UAVs and the jammer UAV, the maximal available propulsion energy at UAVs, and the curvature radius limitations of UAVs' trajectories are concurrently taken into account. In order to maximize the minimum secrecy rate among the ARs, the AR scheduling, the UAVs' power allocation and the trajectories of UAVs are jointly optimized by formulating a multi-variable optimization problem. To solve the non-convex problem efficiently, we present a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based approach, where the penalty dual decomposition (PDD)-based algorithm is designed to optimize the AR scheduling, and successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm is proposed to optimize the UAVs' power allocation and the trajectories of UAVs. The complexity of the presented BCD-based approach is analyzed, which achieves polynomial complexity. Simulation results show that imposing curvature radius limitations on the UAVs' trajectory design is effective to avoid sharp turning of UAVs. Moreover, as curvature radius increases, the system max-min secrecy rate decreases. Besides, the secrecy rate performance of the system can be enhanced by exploiting one jammer UAV to interfere with the URs.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming increasingly important for military operations, including reconnaissance, providing battlefield support, and performing a variety of missions. The possibility of attacking targets using a group of UAVs increases the relevance of protection measures, particularly camouflage. The literature review highlights the experience of using UAVs in military spheres of activity and their high efficiency in reconnaissance and support on the battlefield. Using high-resolution images, visual orientation on the terrain was considered a priority direction of UAV navigation in the operation of electronic warfare tools. Based on hybrid convolutional neural networks, hardware for working with the UAV platform is serially produced. Vines are suggested for masking stationary objects due to their rapid growth and the corresponding quality/cost ratio. The work aims to check the effectiveness of masking small objects using grassy and climbing (lianas) vegetation concerning the prospects of their identification by optical means. The research was conducted using our data obtained from UAVs in the visible range on experimental fields and the botanical hall of NUBiP of Ukraine and on pictures of buildings from the Internet. It has been experimentally established that vegetation's variety of shapes, sizes, and structures complicates the recognition process for convolutional neural networks. The appearance of plants can change significantly depending on the angle of photography, lighting, and the state of mineral nutrition. Organic camouflage in the form of grasses and vines can entirely or partially hide buildings and structures, changing their brightness and contour. This can obscure details and increase the risk of false object recognition. For example, facilities covered with ARISTOLOCHIA MANSHURIENSIS Kom vines were correctly recognized only 27% of the time using neural networks. Convolutional neural networks require a large amount of data to train if the goal is to achieve high accuracy. However, if data with vine-covered objects is limited or unavailable, the training process may need to be improved, affecting the network's ability to recognize such things accurately.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm cooperative decision-making has attracted increasing attentions because of its low-cost, reusable, and distributed characteristics. However, existing non-learning-based methods rely on small-scale, known scenarios, and cannot solve complex multi-agent cooperation problem in large-scale, uncertain scenarios. This paper proposes a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (HMARL) method to solve the heterogeneous UAV swarm cooperative decision-making problem for the typical suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) mission, which is decoupled into two sub-problems, i.e., the higher-level target allocation (TA) sub-problem and the lower-level cooperative attacking (CA) sub-problem. A HMARL agent model, consisting of a multi-agent deep Q network (MADQN) based TA agent and multiple independent asynchronous proximal policy optimization (IAPPO) based CA agents, is established. MADQN-TA agent can dynamically adjust the TA schemes according to the relative position. To encourage exploration and promote learning efficiency, the Metropolis criterion and inter-agent information exchange techniques are introduced. IAPPO-CA agent adopts independent learning paradigm, which can easily scale with the number of agents. Comparative simulation results validate the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are being more and more widely deployed. Although, initially most UAVs were controlled by a pilot, autonomy has increased. This requires the flight controller in the UAV to accurately know the current system state. Knowing the current position is of crucial importance. Fortunately, this can be reliably obtained from a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver. Recently, it was shown that criminal GNSS jamming frequently occurs. First, this paper analyzes the risk posed by off-the-shelf civilian GPS jammers to UAVs. Then, as the main contribution of this paper, a countermeasure is described and implemented using custom hardware and software that allows the control radio to be used as a backup navigation source. Finally, the proposed solution is tested in ideal and field conditions. It is shown that good performance can be obtained by the presented system, almost without additional system cost.},

  year={2024},
  volume={23},
  number={7},
  pages={7060-7078},
  abstract={This paper proposes an integrated sensing, navigation, and communication (ISNC) framework for safeguarding unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled wireless networks against a mobile eavesdropping UAV (E-UAV). To cope with the mobility of the E-UAV, the proposed framework advocates the dual use of artificial noise transmitted by the information UAV (I-UAV) for simultaneous jamming and sensing to facilitate navigation and secure communication. In particular, the I-UAV communicates with legitimate downlink ground users, while avoiding potential information leakage by emitting jamming signals, and estimates the state of the E-UAV with an extended Kalman filter based on the backscattered jamming signals. Exploiting the estimated state of the E-UAV in the previous time slot, the I-UAV determines its flight planning strategy, predicts the wiretap channel, and designs its communication resource allocation policy for the next time slot. To circumvent the severe coupling between these three tasks, a divide-and-conquer approach is adopted. The online navigation design has the objective to minimize the distance between the I-UAV and a pre-defined destination point considering kinematic and geometric constraints. Subsequently, given the predicted wiretap channel, the robust resource allocation design is formulated as an optimization problem to achieve the optimal trade-off between sensing and communication in the next time slot, while taking into account the wiretap channel prediction error and the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of secure communication. To account for the E-UAV state sensing uncertainty and the resulting wiretap channel prediction error, we employ a fully-connected neural network to model the complicated mapping between the state estimation error variance and an upper bound on the channel prediction error, which facilitates the development of a low-complexity suboptimal user scheduling and precoder design algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed design compared with baseline schemes and validate the benefits of integrating sensing and navigation into secure UAV communication systems. We reveal that the dual use of artificial noise can improve both sensing and jamming and that navigation is more important for improving the trade-off between sensing and communications than communication resource allocation.},

  abstract={In Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) networks, the security of transmission faces significant challenges due to the vulnerabilities of line-of-sight links and potential eavesdropping on two-hop links. This paper addresses these challenges with an innovative Cooperative Secure Transmission and Computation strategy (CSTC), specifically engineered for time-slotted UAV-assisted MEC networks plagued by mobile collusive eavesdroppers. These eavesdroppers significantly bolster their interception capabilities through coordinated and optimized movements, escalating the security threats. To neutralize these risks, the proposed CSTC employs the UAV and remote devices as helper nodes to emit jamming signals, thereby thwarting eavesdropping activities, while simultaneously facilitating the efficient relay of users’ tasks to the base station for advanced processing. The CSTC aims to maximize the sum Secrecy Transmission Rate (STR) satisfying task latency constraints. It involves a joint optimization of UAV trajectory, jamming beamformers, transmit power, and data offloading strategy to expedite task transmission. Additionally, a real-time computation scheduling approach is developed based on a newly defined metric, the Urgency Degree of Users (UDoU), to enhance task processing efficiency. Our extensive simulations validate that the CSTC not only elevates the sum STR but also consistently meets latency constraints, demonstrating its robustness against advanced mobile eavesdropping techniques.},

  abstract={In the coming sixth-generation era, space-air–ground integrated network (SAGIN) is a technology with the potential for seamless coverage and high-data rate transmission. However, the inherent broadcast nature of wireless communication forces us to consider physical-layer security. This article explores secure communications with the aid of hybrid free space optical/radio frequency (FSO/RF) links in a two-phase uplink transmission. Specifically, in the first-phase transmission, a ground device transmits secrecy data to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) via an radio frequency (RF) link, while the UAV emits artificial noise to confuse an eavesdropper. In the second-phase transmission, the UAV sends the secrecy data to a satellite via an FSO link to defend against RF eavesdropping. More specifically, we design two transmission schemes, i.e., slot-based scheme and period-based scheme, which are suitable for transmitting delay-sensitive data and delay-insensitive data, respectively. In order to maximize the average secrecy rate of the system, the trajectory and power allocation of the UAV are jointly optimized. The objective functions of these two schemes are both nonconvex, which are mathematically intractable to tackle by the interior-point method. Therefore, we use block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques to obtain approximate solutions. Numerical results reveal the impact of the UAV trajectory and power allocation optimization on the average secrecy rate during different flight periods in different schemes. In addition, other benchmark schemes are considered for comparison, and the results indicate that our proposed schemes can achieve higher average secrecy rates.},

  abstract={To facilitate detection of vessels involved in potentially illegal maritime activities and uphold maritime security, wireless surveillance of suspicious wireless links through eavesdropping technology without requiring physical proximity has emerged as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, effective wireless surveillance of maritime wireless links confronts critical challenges, such as the highly dynamic and complex ocean environment and the risk of being detected during close-range surveillance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cooperative maritime wireless surveillance scheme for suspicious communication links, utilizing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jamming to assist unmanned surface vehicle (USV) monitoring. Specifically, a proactive eavesdropping framework is firstly established, wherein a UAV and a USV collaborate to monitor target link. The UAV transmits beamforming jamming signals to degrade suspicious communications, while the USV conducts eavesdropping to extract valuable information. To maximize the average monitoring rate, an optimization problem is formulated to optimize the trajectory of USV, subject to the mobility constraints during the monitoring process. Given the nonconvex nature of the problem arising from coupled variables and nonlinear constraints, a successive convex approximation (SCA) based algorithm is designed to solve the original problem. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional methods.},

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are highly versatile systems with applications expanding in various fields, for instance, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, Disaster Response, Agriculture, and many more. Although UAVs have many important advantages over conventional manned aircraft, such as cheaper operating costs and a lower risk for human pilots, their vulnerability to Radio Frequency (RF)-jamming poses a substantial risk to navigation and communication systems by disrupting signals. UAVs depend on remote control and autonomous operations. These attacks are concerning in many application areas. Communication and navigation play crucial roles in these autonomous systems. This paper aims to explore different deep-learning algorithms for the detection of RF-jamming attacks in UAVs. A comparison analysis is conducted to evaluate five distinct architectures using conventional evaluation metrics criteria comprising accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrices, and the area under the ROC curve. These comparative analyses helped in selecting an accurate architecture for the definition, RNN architecture gave an impressive accuracy of 93% and demonstrated a superior performance than other architectures. This paper aims to strengthen RF-jamming detection systems in UAVs to enhance their safety and operational reliability in several scenarios.},

  abstract={Almost all military systems and combat platforms rely on GNSS to achieve military missions. However, they are facing more and more intensive jamming and spoofing attacks. Due to the rapid development of computer vision technology and vision sensor, visual navigation and localization technology have gradually revealed their advantages to solve this kind of problem. In this paper, a new framework of visual localization under a GNSS-denied environment is proposed. Firstly, a novel image preprocessing method based on information entropy and granular segmentation is presented which can significantly filtrate the Google tiles in the georeferenced area to parsimony set to reduce UAV localization time. Secondly, we introduce an end-to-end image matching method based on convolutional neural network and image preprocessing to realize UAV localization which has strong robustness and localization accuracy. Finally, the proposed localization algorithm achieves experimental performance on the real images captured by DJI Phantom 3 drone. The good accuracy and fast execution time shown by experiments indicate that the proposed localization algorithm can serve as a powerful tool to keep the UAVs working continuously in the face of intensive jamming and spoofing attacks.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely employed to enhance the end-to-end performance of wireless communications since the links between UAVs and terrestrial nodes are Line-of-Sight (LoS) with high probability. However, the broadcast characteristics of signal propagation in LoS links make them vulnerable to being wiretapped by malicious eavesdroppers, which poses a considerable challenge to the security of wireless communications. In this work, we investigate the security of aerial underlay Internet of Things (IoT) systems by jointly designing trajectory and user scheduling. An airborne base station transmits confidential messages to secondary users utilizing the same spectrum as the primary network. An aerial jammer transmits jamming signals to suppress the eavesdropper to enhance secrecy performance. The uncertainty of eavesdropping node locations is considered, and the average secrecy rate of the secondary user is maximized by optimizing multiple users’ scheduling, the UAVs’ trajectory, and transmit power. To solve the nonconvex optimization problem with a mixed multi-integer variable problem, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate that our scheme is beneficial in improving the secrecy performance of aerial underlay IoT systems.},

To maximize the system performance, we formulate an optimization problem to jointly design the UAV’s trajectory and Alice’s transmit power.

In order to eliminate these requirements, this work, for the first time, develops a geometric (GM) method to solve the optimization problem. By analyzing the covertness constraint, the GM method decouples the joint optimization into optimizing the UAV’s trajectory and Alice’s transmit power separately. Our examination shows that the GM method can significantly outperform the CI method in terms of achieving a higher average covert rate and the complexity of the GM method is lower than that of the CI method.},

Our contributions are manifold: first, we revise the jamming based anti-drone techniques; second, we introduce a basic model for JAM-ME and accompanying mathematical tool-rooted in systems control theory. Further, we show through an extensive simulation campaign that JAM-ME do allow a drone to accomplish its mission in a jammed area. Finally, we also discuss possible techniques to mitigate the impact of JAM-ME as well as its limitations, and we conclude highlighting further research directions.

One method for countering their operation in restricted areas is by transmitting a high-powered jamming signal over the frequencies used by the target drone. To improve the performance of jammers, full-duplex is introduced. In full-duplex systems, the transceiver is able to transmit and receive using the same time-frequency resources, which allows a device to conduct spectrum monitoring while preventing drone operations by transmitting jamming. In this study, the self-interference cancelation of typical jamming waveforms is experimentally measured and signal detection is performed over samples with imperfect self-interference cancelation.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) play an essential role in future wireless communication networks due to their high mobility, low cost, and on-demand deployment. In air-to-ground links, UAVs are widely used to enhance the performance of wireless communication systems due to the presence of high-probability line-of-sight (LoS) links. However, the high probability of LoS links also increases the risk of being eavesdropped, posing a significant challenge to the security of wireless communications. In this work, the secure problem in a multi-UAV-assisted communication system is investigated in a moving airborne eavesdropping scenario. To improve the secrecy performance of the considered communication system, aerial eavesdropping capability is suppressed by sending jamming signals from a friendly UAV. An optimization problem under flight conditions, fairness, and limited energy consumption constraints of multiple UAVs is formulated to maximize the fair sum secrecy throughput. Given the complexity and non-convex nature of the problem, we propose a two-step-based optimization approach. The first step employs the K-means algorithm to cluster users and associate them with multiple communication UAVs. Then, a heterogeneous multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient based algorithm is introduced to solve this optimization problem. The effectiveness of this proposed algorithm is not only theoretically but also rigorously verified by simulation results.},

  abstract={A multitude of applications based on unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAVs), in conjunction with the UAVs' diminishing costs and increasing capabilities, present a major threat to public safety as well as critical infrastructure security, leading to the need for versatile and robust counter-drone solutions. This work presents a novel multi-agent jamming system, where a group of cooperative autonomous agents employ various algorithms (detection, tracking, jamming, and self-localization) to counter unauthorized drone operations. The proposed system employs a joint wireless jamming and cooperative positioning framework to best track and intercept the moving rogue drone, utilizing a relative positioning system based on signals of opportunity in conjunction with inertial and vision measurements. Software-defined radio technology is incorporated on the pursuer agent to achieve rogue drone GPS disruption, while at the same time the autonomous agents cooperate to compute the location estimate of the pursuer agent. In the presence of jamming, to improve the wireless communication performance of the autonomous agents, a cellular communication architecture is also used as an additional channel for control and information exchange. For evaluation purposes, a prototype multi-agent system is designed, implemented, and tested in a real-world environment to demonstrate its enhanced localization and jamming performance, when compared to single-agent approaches.},

  abstract={Space-air-ground networks have received a lot of attention due to its extensive coverage characteristics. However, it also faces many unprecedented security challenges. This paper considers a space-air-ground network with an airship acting as an eavesdropper. To counter the eavesdropping threat, the unmanned aerial vehicle transmits artificial noise to jam the eavesdropper. We first consider the scenario without the no-fly zone, to maximize the system secrecy energy efficiency. Specifically, we formulate it into a fractional programming optimization problem, which jointly optimizes the UAV trajectory design and the jamming power, and then decompose it into two subproblems, i.e., trajectory-related and power-related subproblems. To derive the solution, we employ Dinkelbach algorithm, successive convex approximation algorithm, and the method of introducing slack variables to convert the non-convex subproblems into convex forms. The convergence of the developed algorithm and the complexity of our proposed scheme are analytically evaluated. Moreover, we consider the scenario with a no-fly zone and derive the solution. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can effectively improve the system secrecy energy efficiency.},

  abstract={This article investigates a novel anti-eavesdropping strategy based on uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). In particular, a UAV equipped with a STAR-RIS acts as a passive relay to reflect desired signals and simultaneously acts as a friendly jammer to transmit artificial noise (AN) against eavesdroppers. Based on the phase shift coupling characteristics of STAR-RIS, three phase shift configuration strategies are proposed, namely reliability-priority (RP), security-priority (SP), and element-partitioning (EP) schemes. Analytical closed-form expressions of connection outage probability (COP), secrecy outage probability (SOP), effective secrecy throughput (EST), and secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) are derived to evaluate the reliable and secure performance achieved by the proposed schemes, respectively. The asymptotic analysis is also performed for further insights. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed three schemes outperform traditional benchmark schemes. From the perspective of reliability, the RP scheme can achieve the best COP. In terms of security, as the number of STAR-RIS elements increases, the SOPs of the SP and EP exponentially decrease, whereas the SOP of the RP scheme increases. The EP scheme achieves the optimal EST, and the asymptotic EST is independent of phase estimation errors. Additionally, it is recommended that the UAV be deployed near the eavesdropper for the SP and EP schemes to enhance SEE.},

  year={2024},
  volume={11},
  number={8},
  pages={14682-14697},
  abstract={The current state of the art on jamming detection relies on link-layer metrics. A few examples are the bit-error rate (BER), the packet delivery ratio, the throughput, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). As a result, these techniques can only detect jamming ex-post, i.e., once the attack has already taken down the communication link. These solutions are unfit for mobile devices, e.g., drones, which might lose the connection to the remote controller, being unable to predict the attack. Our solution is rooted in the idea that a drone unknowingly flying toward a jammed area is experiencing an increasing effect of the jamming, e.g., in terms of BER and SNR. Therefore, drones might use the abovementioned phenomenon to detect jamming before the increase of the BER and the decrease of the SNR completely disrupt the communication link. Such an approach would allow drones and their pilots to make informed decisions and maintain complete control of navigation, enhancing security and safety. This article proposes Bloodhound+, a solution for jamming detection on mobile devices in low-BER regimes. Our approach analyzes raw physical-layer information (I-Q samples) acquired from the wireless channel. We assemble this information into grayscale images and use sparse autoencoders to detect image anomalies caused by jamming attacks. To test our solution against a broad set of configurations, we acquired a large data set of indoor measurements using multiple hardware, jamming strategies, and communication parameters. Our results indicate that Bloodhound+ can detect indoor jamming up to 20 m from the jamming source at the minimum available relative jamming power, with a minimum accuracy of 99.7%. Our solution is also robust to various sampling rates adopted by the jammer and to the type of signal used for jamming.},

  abstract={Navigation services based on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are essential for a wide range of global applications, including ensuring the safety of aerial vehicles. However, these GNSS signals (e. g., civilian GPS) are vulnerable to jamming and spoofing attacks. To mitigate such threats, we propose GridNet, a vision-based deep-learning technique to counter GPS jamming and spoofing attacks on aerial vehicles. GridNet uses visual devices (e.g., cameras) to determine geolocation during such attacks by extracting geolocation from aerial photos via a pre-trained neural network model. This non-invasive approach does not modify existing GPS infrastructure, merely relying on real-time visual data. Unlike other methods that focus solely on attack detection, GridNet provides a countermeasure, calculating geolocation data without GPS. We analyze the potential applications and discuss the performance in different flight environments. Experimental results show that GridNet can extract geolocation data from real aerial photos, achieving nearly 93% spoofing detection accuracy with a minimum average geolocation error of 7.33 meters within 4ms on a ground station server and 2.7ms on a typical UAV, respectively, offering a practical anti-spoofing solution.},

  abstract={To explore the airspace structure and safety performance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system based on spatial digital twins (DTs), the study introduces DTs technology, and combines convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm with UAV autonomous network. The DTs system of UAV is constructed by using wireless communication technology, and its security performance is simulated. The results show that in the analysis of the system packet loss rate, it is found that with the increase of the acquisition points, the amount of transmitted data only increases slightly, but the packet loss rate does not change significantly. In the analysis of the network performance of the unmanned aircraft system, it is found that the node energy-based weighted clustering algorithm (EWCA) can be used to increase the life of the overall network and enhance its availability by rationally controlling the number of nodes and the number of switching between clusters. As the number of nodes increases, the minimum survival time of each clustering algorithm decreases linearly. When the number of nodes is less than 600, the growth rate of cluster head is higher; When the number of nodes is more than 600, the curve growth is relatively smooth. In the analysis of the probability of network safety interruption, it is found that using the model constructed, when the energy acquisition coefficient is close to 0.5, the energy conversion efficiency is higher, the signal-to-noise ratio is larger. Also, when the number of intermediate nodes is increased to 10, the UAV has the best network safety performance. Therefore, through the research, it is found that the UAV DTs system constructed can significantly improve the safety performance of the UAV during its airspace flight. It can provide experimental references for the widespread application of the UAV in the later period.},

  abstract={This paper studies the physical layer security of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network, where a UAV base station (UAV-B) transmits confidential information to multiple information receivers (IRs) with the aid of a UAV jammer (UAV-J) in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers. We formulate an optimization problem to jointly design the trajectories and transmit power of UAV-B and UAV-J in order to maximize the minimum average secrecy rate over all IRs. The optimization problem is non-convex and the optimization variables are coupled, which leads to the optimization problem being mathematically intractable. As such, we decompose the optimization problem into two subproblems and then solve it by employing an alternating iterative algorithm and the successive convex approximation technique. Our results show that the average secrecy rate performance of the proposed scheme provides about 20% and 150% performance gains over the joint trajectory and transmit power optimization without UAV-J scheme and the transmit power optimization with fixed trajectory scheme at flight period T = 150 s, respectively.},

  abstract={In this article, we aim to explore the potential of using onboard cameras and pre-stored geo-referenced imagery for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) localization. Such a vision-based localization enhancing system is of vital importance, particularly in situations where the integrity of the global positioning system (GPS) is in question (i.e., in the occurrence of GPS outages, jamming, etc.). To this end, we propose a complete trainable pipeline to localize an aerial image in a pre-stored orthomosaic map in the context of UAV localization. The proposed deep architecture extracts the features from the aerial imagery and localizes it in a pre-ordained, larger, and geotagged image. The idea is to train a deep learning model to find neighborhood consensus patterns that encapsulate the local patterns in the neighborhood of the established dense feature correspondences by introducing semi-local constraints. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the performance of our approach on real UAV imagery. The training and testing data is acquired via multiple flights over different regions. The source code along with the entire dataset, including the annotations of the collected images has been made public.11https://github.com/m-hamza-mughal/Aerial-Template-Matching. Up-to our knowledge, such a dataset is novel and first of its kind which consists of 2052 high-resolution aerial images acquired at different times over three different areas in Pakistan spanning a total area of around 2 km2.},

  abstract={With the development of artificial intelligence, multiagent algorithms have been applied to many real-time strategy games. Making plans on the human being is gradually passing away, especially in combat scenarios. Cognitive electronic warfare (CEW) is a complex and challenging work due to the sensitivity of the data sources. There are few studies on CEW. In the past, wargame simulations depended on differential equations and war theory, which resulted in high time and human resource costs. In the future, as other artificial intelligence theories are developed, artificial intelligence will play a more critical role in wargames. The capabilities of multiagent modeling to describe complex systems and predict actions in dynamic environments are superior to those of traditional methods. In this paper, we use a 3D wargame engine from China Aerospace System Simulation Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing) named All Domain Simulation (ACS), which supports land, sea, and air combat scenarios, to simulate combat. In the simulations, there are several unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) as attackers and several radar stations as defenders, and both have the ability to detect the others. In the game, several UAVs need to learn to detect targets and track targets separately, and we train the UAV's behavior by well-designed reward shaping and multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) with LSTM. We improved the RDPG algorithm and merged the MADDPG and RDPG algorithms. From the experimental results, we can see that the effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithm have been greatly improved.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and Terahertz (THz) technology are envisioned to play paramount roles in next-generation wireless communications. In this paper, we present a novel secure UAV-assisted mobile relaying system operating at THz bands for data acquisition from multiple ground user equipments (UEs) towards a destination. We assume that the UAV-mounted relay may act, besides providing relaying services, as a potential eavesdropper called the untrusted UAV-relay (UUR). To safeguard end-to-end communications, we present a secure two-phase transmission strategy with cooperative jamming. Then, we devise an optimization framework in terms of a new measure $-$ secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), defined as the ratio of achievable average secrecy rate to average system power consumption, which enables us to obtain the best possible security level while taking UUR’s inherent flight power limitation into account. For the sake of quality of service fairness amongst all the UEs, we aim to maximize the minimum SEE (MSEE) performance via the joint design of key system parameters, including UUR’s trajectory and velocity, communication scheduling, and network power allocation. Since the formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex optimization and computationally intractable, we decouple it into four subproblems and propose alternative algorithms to solve it efficiently via greedy/sequential block successive convex approximation and non-linear fractional programming techniques. Numerical results demonstrate significant MSEE performance improvement of our designs compared to other known benchmarks.},

  abstract={Localization of low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) often relies on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). GNSS are susceptible to both natural disruptions to radio signal and intentional jamming and spoofing by an adversary. A typical way to provide georeferenced localization without GNSS for small UAVs is to have a downward-facing camera and match camera images to a map. The downward-facing camera adds cost, size, and weight to the UAV platform and the orientation limits its usability for other purposes. In this work, we propose a Monte-Carlo localization method for georeferenced localization of an UAV requiring no infrastructure using only inertial measurements, a camera facing an arbitrary direction, and an orthoimage map. We perform orthorectification of the UAV image, relying on a local planarity assumption of the environment, relaxing the requirement of downward-pointing camera. We propose a measure of goodness for the matching score of an orthorectified UAV image and a map. We demonstrate that the system is able to localize globally an UAV with modest requirements for initialization and map resolution.},

  abstract={Formal modeling techniques can be exploited for autonomous vehicle modeling, enabling resilient navigation inside container terminals (CTs). Road vehicles will be characterized by a new intelligent vehicle technology such as Intelligent Autonomous vehicle (IAV) compared to the trucks, which are able to bring containers within the Terminal Container (TC) based on GPS. In the TC, electric unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) present in the TC are able to emulate redundant positioning data from the IAV, where its signals are disturbed within the corridor of containers. Petri nets are formal models suitable for modeling and controlling classes of systems such as transportation systems. They allow to control the movement of the IAV while reconstructing the positioning data of the IAV. This is ensured by GPS or by communication between the IAV that loses its position and the IAV s close to it, the other drones, and the crane. Thus, this paper proposes a reconfiguration strategy for the IAV to manage its navigation under resilient conditions, even if it loses its own GPS signal. Simulation results and perspectives are presented in this paper.},

  abstract={Two of the major challenges with beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) operations for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) today are navigation and communication. This paper presents a solution that takes on both problems simultaneously, using a phased array radio system (PARS) both for communication and to aid a micro-electro-mechanical inertial navigation system (INS), estimating position, velocity and attitude. The solution is independent of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) for positioning and highly resistant to malicious sources, such as spoofing and jamming. The state estimator presented in this paper fuses range and bearing measurements from the PARS with the measurements from an on-board inertial measurement unit, a magnetometer and a barometer. By aiding the INS with PARS position measurements, magnetometer readings and barometric measurements, drift-free PVA estimates are obtained. The PARS measurements can be used for navigation alongside today's GNSS solutions, or as a redundant backup system running in parallel. To validate the observer, an experiment was carried out with a fixed wing UAV on an approximately 35 minute flight with a maximal distance of 5.35 km from the base station. During this flight a root-mean-square accuracy of 26.3 m compared to a real-time kinematic GNSS solution was achieved.},

  abstract={The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are competent to perform a variety of applications, possessing great potential and promise. The deep neural networks (DNN) technology has enabled the UAV-assisted paradigm, accelerated the construction of smart cities, and propelled the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). UAVs play an increasingly important role in various applications, such as surveillance, environmental monitoring, emergency rescue, and supplies delivery, for which a robust path-planning technique is the foundation and prerequisite. However, existing methods lack comprehensive consideration of the complicated urban environment and do not provide an overall assessment of the robustness and generalization. Meanwhile, due to the resource constraints and hardware limitations of UAVs, the complexity of deploying the network needs to be reduced. This article proposes a lightweight, reinforcement-learning-based (RL-based) real-time path-planning method for UAVs, adaptive SAC (ASAC) algorithm, which optimizing the training process, network architecture, and algorithmic models. First of all, we establish a framework of global training and local adaptation, where the structured environment model is constructed for interaction, and local dynamically varying information aids in improving generalization. Second, ASAC introduces a cross-layer connection approach that passes the original state information into the higher layers to avoid feature loss and improve learning efficiency. Finally, we propose an adaptive temperature coefficient, which flexibly adjusts the exploration probability of UAVs with the training phase and experience data accumulation. In addition, a series of comparison experiments have been conducted in conjunction with practical application requirements, and the results have fully proved the favorable superiority of ASAC.},

  abstract={An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided secure communication system is conceived and investigated, where the UAV transmits legitimate information to a ground user in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). To guarantee the security, the UAV employs a power splitting approach, where its transmit power can be divided into two parts for transmitting confidential messages and artificial noise (AN), respectively. We aim to maximize the average secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory, the transmit power levels and the corresponding power splitting ratios allocated to different time slots during the whole flight time, subject to both the maximum UAV speed constraint, the total mobility energy constraint, the total transmit power constraint, and other related constraints. To efficiently tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm by blending the benefits of the block coordinate descent (BCD) method, the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Specially, we show that the proposed algorithm exhibits very low computational complexity and each of its updating steps can be formulated in a nearly closed form. Besides, it can be easily extended to the case of three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design. Our simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract={With the growing adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) across various domains, the security of their operations is paramount. UAVs, heavily dependent on GPS navigation, are at risk of jamming and spoofing cyberattacks, which can severely jeopardize their performance, safety, and mission integrity. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are typically employed as defense mechanisms, often leveraging traditional machine learning techniques. However, these IDSs are susceptible to adversarial attacks that exploit machine learning models by introducing input perturbations. In this work, we propose a novel IDS for UAVs to enhance resilience against such attacks using generative adversarial networks (GAN). We also comprehensively study several evasion-based adversarial attacks and utilize them to compare the performance of the proposed IDS with existing ones. The resilience is achieved by generating synthetic data based on the identified weak points in the IDS and incorporating these adversarial samples in the training process to regularize the learning. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed IDS is significantly robust against adversarial machine learning-based attacks compared to the state-of-the-art IDSs while maintaining a low false positive rate.},

  abstract={As an emerging field beyond the Fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication technology, the space-air-ground (SAG) integrated networks provide a promising data collection paradigm for Internet of remote things (IoRT) networks where terrestrial infrastructures are usually unavailable.

To solve this continuous control and long-term sequential decision-making problem, we propose a learning-based IoRT data collection against jamming (LIDCAJ) framework, which contains a deep neural network (DNN) model based on DRL for policy learning, and a temporal sequence model based on LSTM for historical trajectory modeling. Furthermore, we conduct extensive simulations to verify the effectiveness of the LIDCAJ.

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used in a variety of applications in safety-critical domains such as logistics, transportation, and defense. However, safety assurance is needed for the widespread development and operation of UAVs in urban areas where a failure may lead to physical harm to people, environment, or property. Since UAV s are highly interconnected, security is an important concern for the acceptance of safety-critical UAV applications. Thus, it is needed to ensure that UAV s are protected from attacks, e.g., Global Position System (GPS) signal spoofing, and unauthorized manipulation of flight controls, caused by malicious external agents aiming to compromise system/data confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Artificial Intelligence techniques such as Machine Learning classifiers can be used to support the identification of UAV s attacks. This study presents the development of safety and security diagnostic methods for UAVs. Two multiclass approaches are proposed, focusing on identifying safety-related failures and security threats such as GPS spoofing and jamming attacks. Various machine learning algorithms are employed, and evaluation metrics demonstrate high accuracy rates across models. The study underscores the importance of addressing both safety and security aspects in UAV s operations and provides pre-processing code for reproducibility. The developed methods contribute to enhancing UAV resilience and understanding safety and security measures in unmanned aerial operations.},

  abstract={The paper presents an architecture design of a custom drone whose mission consists in reproducing typical cinematographic shots in unstructured environments, where loss or degradation of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal can be experienced due to jamming, spoofing, and multipath effects. In this application field, an accurate measurement system is required to estimate the drone position and attitude with a high-accuracy level; in fact, not only do these values have a remarkable impact on the execution of the cinematographic shots, but they also allow to adopt drones in critical environmental conditions such as tunnels, bridges, canyon, and desert which are typical for these applications. The preliminary configuration is designed considering Unmanned Vehicle’s navigation and communication requirements; in particular, the paper proposes the integration of a tactical-grade Inertial Navigation Unit (IMU) and an accurate GNSS receiver in RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) mode, and the employment of a 5G Radio-modem to compensate for any signal loss or damage. In addition, an appropriate hardware selection algorithm is proposed to also account for power consumption due to 5G and GNSS module usage depending on the mission type and on the GNSS integrity signal. The employment of 5G technology is then proposed as an advantageous solution in case of GNSS signal loss or damage and, finally, a suitable GNSS/5G integrated methodology is assessed.},

  abstract={Now-a-days, drones become increasingly popular for various applications, including surveillance, delivery, and inspection. However, they are vulnerable to attacks, especially GPS spoofing and jamming, which can disrupt their GPS signals and cause them to crash.

Beyond GPS attacks, cybersecurity for drones is a broader issue that includes denial-of-service attacks, malware attacks, and physical attacks on the drone itself. These attacks can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of drone systems, posing significant risks to operators and the public. To address these threats, ongoing research and development of countermeasures are needed, as new and more sophisticated attacks may continue to emerge as technology advances. The development of effective countermeasures requires collaboration among academia, industry, and government agencies to ensure that drone systems are robust, resilient, and secure against cyber and physical attacks. Additionally, regulations and standards must be established to ensure the safe and secure operation of drones, including cybersecurity requirements that mandate secure communication, authentication, and encryption protocols. In summary, the increasing use of drones in various applications highlights the importance of addressing the cybersecurity challenges that arise from their use. The development of effective countermeasures to GPS spoofing, jamming, and other attacks is critical to ensuring the safety and security of drone systems, operators, and the public. Ongoing research and collaboration among stakeholders are essential to achieving this goal and to mitigating the risks associated with drone operations.},

  abstract={The high precision (centimetre accuracy) positioning systems are set to play a key role in revolutionising smart farming, self-driving cars, drone deliveries, heavy machine navigation, etc. With so much at stake the technology also needs protection from an intentional sabotage or denial of service. It is very easy with current satellite-based navigation jammers to disrupt a navigation service. Our proposed technology solves this challenge in a compact and cost-effective way. Compared to normal navigation patch antennas our proposed dual ring antenna offers over 30 dB of protection. Thus, if a patch antenna-based navigation system is disturbed at 1 watt of interference power, it will take 1000 watts to disrupt navigation system working on our proposed system. With the size of only 130 mm × 130 mm and cheap large-scale manufacturing, our proposed antenna is perfectly suitable for applications for safety and prosperity of the smart nation-based living.},

  abstract={Drone susceptibility to jamming or spoofing attacks of GPS, RF, Wi-Fi, and operator signals presents a danger to medical delivery systems. A detection framework capable of sensing attacks on drones could provide the capability for active responses. The identification of interference attacks has applicability in medical delivery, disaster zone relief, and FAA enforcement against illegal jamming activities. A gap exists in the literature for solo or swarm-based drones to identify radio frequency spectrum attacks. Any non-delivery specific function, such as attack sensing, added to a drone involves a weight increase and additional complexity; therefore, the value must exceed the disadvantages. Medical delivery, high-value cargo, and disaster zone applications could present a value proposition that overcomes the additional costs. The paper examines types of attacks against drones and describes a framework for designing an attack detection system with active response capabilities to improve the reliability of delivery and other medical applications.},

UAVs equipped with radio DF systems are widely used in communication, navigation and electronic warfare area among others. However, the DF systems usually require a pair of antennas or more, tending to make them bulky and heavy for smaller UAVs. To alleviate this issue, we propose a single-element DF antenna which can employ the rotating propellers of the UAV to steer its radiation pattern. Simulation and numerical experiment results demonstrate that this antenna can achieve direction of arrival estimation accuracy that is similar to conventional mechanically-rotating dipoles without putting additional moving parts on the UAV.},

  abstract={To safeguard legitimate users from potential malicious eavesdropping, this letter proposes a dynamic role switching scheme (RSS) in multi-UAV assisted secure communication networks, where each UAV is allowed to collect offloading data from ground users (GUs) or generate artificial noise to suppress eavesdropper users (EUs). Given the scarcity of on-board resources, UAVs are expected to accomplish missions as soon as possible. Therefore, a dichotomy and successive convex approximation (dichotomy-SCA) combined algorithm is further designed to minimize the mission completion time (MCT) by the joint optimization of role assignment, trajectory and jamming power of UAVs. Numerical simulations illustrate that the proposed algorithm can be fast converged within limited iterations and outperform the role fixed scheme (RFS) with a better system performance. Meanwhile, MCT can be greatly reduced with a comparable average secure rate (ASR) compared with ASR maximizing algorithm.},

  abstract={With the intensification of uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) “black flight” threat, the dynamic cooperative deployment of navigation spoofing jamming sites faces the triple challenges of integrity coverage, spoofing signal mutual interference suppression, and resource cost optimization. In this paper, we propose an intelligent deployment framework that breaks through the limitations of traditional algorithms of fixing the number of stations, fixing the radius, and optimizing only the location of stations. By constructing a multi-objective optimization model, we innovatively design a hybrid optimization mechanism that includes velocity-position update with local-best-driven, site-adaptive maintenance, and directed mutation. Among them, the local-best-driven module generates particle motion gradients through site-level dual-objective evaluation to solve the global guidance failure problem in dynamic scenarios; the site-adaptive maintenance module achieves site-level dynamic optimization through the judgement of site absence and redundancy; and the directed mutation module further optimizes the redundant resources through the transformation of inefficient sites. Simulation results demonstrate that this method significantly improves the reliability and economy of the deployment of the active protection system in the complex electromagnetic environment and provides theoretical support for the construction of adaptive protection networks in critical areas such as cities and coastal areas.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in cooperative data transmission owing to its highly controllable maneuverability and scalability. Yet, when the distance is long, deployment density is low, and malicious jamming exists in the scenario, it becomes impossible for UAVs to deliver data as relaying in real-time. To resolve this challenge, we propose an innovative UAV cooperative end-to-end data transmission approach leveraging the resonant motion concept(here after we refer as RM), making it possible. Then, based on the channel scenario of the Rician fading model, the closed expression of the RM link outage probability is derived, and the influence of malicious jamming on the performance of the RM link is analyzed from the perspective of the outage probability. Finally, by comparing and analyzing the outage probability of the traditional relaying UAV and RM transmission mode, simulation results show that in the same scenario, the link outage probability of the UAV-based system with RM motion is lower and the antijamming performance is better.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of UAV control link and ad hoc network, and the low success rate of single UAV mission, a large number of UAVs have become the mainstream in disaster relief, security and other fields. In the airport, the interference and Countermeasure of the competition venue against UAVs has become the core link of security in large-scale events and important places. The existing interference sources are mainly single point interference. Due to the shielding of buildings, it is impossible to fully cover the venue. Therefore, distributed interference optimization is the best option to combat large-scale UAVs in the future. On the basis of summarizing the jamming benefit evaluation system, this paper introduces the probability of jamming source discovery as the jamming cost, and establishes the satellite navigation distributed jamming optimization model. Tabu search artificial bee colony algorithm (TSABC) is proposed to solve the problems of slow interference speed and low success rate of traditional distributed interference optimization algorithm. The algorithm proposed in this paper is compared with ABC algorithm and PSO algorithm in interference countermeasure scenario. The simulation results show that the TSABC algorithm proposed in this paper effectively improves the interference efficiency and can quickly and accurately interfere with a large number of UAVs.},

  pages={235-240},
  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) utilise the Global Positioning System (GPS) for navigation. Nevertheless, it is susceptible to obstruction and jamming threats. This paper investigates LoRa (Long Range) technology to create a redundant UAV localisation system, addressing the challenges of GPS dependency and vulnerability to signal disruptions. The system operates at 915 MHz, utilising Arduino and LoRa transceivers for Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) -based trilateration. LoRa provides an operational radius of up to 20 km in line of sight, providing GPS-free UAV navigation. Real-time monitoring and analyses have been performed via MATLAB and the IoT-based cloud platform, ThingSpeak. The experiment demonstrated that UAV localisation can be performed in line-of-sight (LoS) and Non-line-of-sight (NLoS) environments. The findings suggest that the path loss exponents of 3.2 and 3.4 were suitable for the area in which the experiment was conducted. LoRa’s exceptional capabilities such as its low power, long range and geolocation, help address the urgent demand for reliability in military, civilian surveillance and disaster response contexts. Future research is necessary to develop a complete UAV localisation system that utilises trilateration and LoRa technology. Further work can include testing with different antennas, testing in different environments and producing a real-time monitoring application.},

  abstract={It is anticipated that the backbone of Smart Cities concerning automation and networking will be formed by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in the imminent future. Therefore, our research focuses on developing advanced microcontrollers embedded with Artificial Intelligence techniques for self-governing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The main objective of this research was to enable full automation for the execution of flight paths with non-trivial sequences that will be performed with centimetre-level accuracy. Also, by utilising dynamic flight plans and trajectories, we aim to secure autonomous aviation based on norms, with control loops and fundamental constraints. More specifically, we evolved a novel algorithmic technique for trajectory optimisation, which deploys a modification to the A* search algorithm, implemented by the Haversine formula and enhances accuracy using Vincenty's formula. Furthermore, realistic values for trajectory optimisation and obstacle avoidance were found through the implementation of a simulative investigation. The outcomes of our methodology indicate that the safety constraints associated with the integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in the urban environment can be significantly mitigated. Consequently, their effectiveness will be increased in realising their diverse operations and capabilities.},

  abstract={In order to solve the problem of distributed cooperative jamming task allocation of UAV swarm, an optimal allocation method based on improving the cover efficiency of manned aircraft is proposed. Firstly, based on the cooperative interference of multiple UAVs, a model of common detection exposure area of networked radar is established.Then, according to the concept of safety zone in the jamming effectiveness evaluation criterion, a more objective and comprehensive jamming evaluation function model is established by combining the shortest distance between the manned aircraft and the exposed area boundary, the feasible area range for the manned aircraft to plan the safe track in the next step and the degree of suppression of the radar exposed area. Finally, based on the multi-pheromone ant colony algorithm, the adjustment and improvement are made to adjust the pheromone learning rate and path planning strategy more intelligently, improve the model optimization rate and optimization ability, and give the specific implementation logic. Through simulation, it is found that this method has more stable and fast convergence ability than traditional genetic algorithm, and has stronger global optimization ability than traditional ant colony algorithm. Especially With the expansion of operation scale, the convergence performance of the algorithm is more prominent, and it has better real-time operation and can be closer to practical application.},

  abstract={In recent years, more and more attention has been paid to the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) cooperative task assignment. In order to complete the task with the lowest cost, some researchers use multi-objective optimization to solve the assignment problem. But few of them consider the complex dynamic scenarios. In this article, the time-varying resource supply and demands are provided by established digital twins (DTs) of UAVs and targets, thereby enabling accurate decision guidance for dynamic task assignment. It takes the scheduling cost, path cost, risk cost and total task time cost as the optimization objectives. To solve this model, an improved dynamic multi-objective adaptive weighted particle swarm Optimization algorithm (DMOAWPSO) is proposed. In the initialization stage, a heuristic method is used to increase the effectiveness of the solution. Besides, the adaptive mutation and subgroup methods are adopted to improve the diversity of the solution. Then, effective environment change detection and response strategies are designed to adapt to dynamic scenarios. Finally, the evaluation metrics are calculated in different instances. Compared with the popular and classic dynamic multi-objective algorithms, the simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm is effective and can cope with the environment changes better in solving the task assignment problem.},

Currently, the most cost-effective means of defense is UAV jamming and deception, based on the time-delayed single- station GPS forwarding deception jamming can realize the long- distance deception of UAV, interfere with their satellite positioning, and force them to deviate from the established route. This paper addresses the problems of low correlation between the deception trajectory and the original planned route, as well as unspecified destination areas in current domestic and foreign research on static deception, one-way deception, and fluctuation curve deception. A single station UAVs synchronous deception model is designed, and a delay control algorithm for synchronous deception is proposed.

  pages={121497-121511},
  abstract={This study proposes a positioning system that allows a drone to determine its location independently of external data sources. The system is one of the key factors in achieving blindfolded flight, which is the ability to follow a predetermined flight route using only the aircraft’s internal data, even in the presence of spoofing, interference, or unavailability of any positioning systems. The system remains operational even when the sensor signals are of low quality. The GPS spoofing detection method based on this system effectively manages slow drift attacks, and its stability is demonstrated by the small coefficients of variation (CVs) of detection delays. The prediction of the current position is based on deep learning rather than motion equations. Existing approaches to blindfolded flight are constrained by cost, flight time, or flight distance. The proposed system does not significantly suffer from these limitations. The flight time limitations of the latest studies are approximately 100 s. The system demonstrates no tendency for prediction error to increase over time during the 360-second flight, regardless of the presence of GPS spoofing attacks.},

  abstract={Pilot assignment is a major issue in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled user centric (UC) cell- free massive multiple input and multiple output (UC-CF-mMIMO) wireless networks where, UAVs function as distributed mobile aerial access points (MAAPs). In this paper, an efficient Tabu-search (TS) based pilot assignment scheme is proposed to address this issue where, a penalty based objective function maintains a minimum distance between mobile units (MUs). This scheme utilizes a local neighborhood search, where we first define the neighborhood structure and set the objective function. The proposed algorithm iteratively identifies a near-optimal solution with low computational overhead and achieves high average channel estimate power. We implemented a gradient based (GB) algorithm to optimize the 3D locations of MAAPs and find the signal-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expression. Numerical simulations show that proposed TS-based strategy and MAAP trajectory optimization significantly enhance the per-user throughput with 95%-likelihood. The results achieved with proposed method are better than the conventional random pilot assignment schemes such as, gradient based and gibbs sampling (GB-GS), user centric perfect channel state information(UC-PSCI) and mMIMO based PCSI method while maintaining similar complexity.},
