abstract = {The application of intelligent collaborative drone clusters in both civilian and military fields is becoming increasingly widespread, and the autonomous collaboration mechanism within the cluster is the key to efficiently and reliably completing tasks. In a drone cluster, routing protocol, as a key technology for self-organizing networks, directly determines the performance of the entire system. However, the dynamically changing topology, unbalanced business load, and uncertain network size pose significant challenges to protocol design. This article systematically introduces various routing protocols for unmanned aerial vehicle self-organizing networks based on networking requirements, and analyzes the task scenarios applicable to each routing protocol; Then, a comparative study was conducted on various routing protocols, and finally, the future research directions of routing protocols for unmanned aerial vehicle self-organizing networks were discussed.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have various applications in different settings, including for example, surveillance, packet delivery, emergency response, data collection in the Internet of Things (IoT), and connectivity in cellular networks. However, this technology comes with many risks and challenges such as vulnerabilities to malicious cyber-physical attacks. This article studies the problem of path planning for UAVs under GPS sensor permanent faults in a cyber-physical system (CPS) perspective. Based on studying and analyzing the CPS architecture of the UAV, the cyber “attacks and threats” are differentiated from attacks on sensors and communication components. An efficient way to address this problem is to introduce a novel approach for UAV’s path planning resilience to cyber-attack artificial potential field (RCA-APF) algorithm. The proposed algorithm completes the three stages in a coordinated manner. In the first stage, the permanent faults on the GPS sensor of the UAV are detected, and the UAV starts to divert from its initial path planning. In the second stage, we estimated the location of the UAV under GPS permanent fault using received signal strength (RSS) trilateration localization approach. In the final stage of the algorithm, we implemented the path planning of the UAV using an open source UAV simulator. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate the performance of the algorithm and its effectiveness, resulting in efficient path planning for the UAV.},

In this paper, we investigate a SWIPT system assisted by UAV in jamming environment, where the UAV can transfer power to nodes and nodes can collect energy from the UAV. In order to maximize the minimum throughput among all IoTDs, we jointly optimize the transmit power of IoTDs and the trajectory of UAV during a fix period, while ensuring the lowest energy requirement of each node and avoiding jamming. However, the problem we proposed is NP-hard and difficult to be settled efficiently by existing methods. To address the intractable problem, we develop an iterative algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach. Simulation results indicate that our joint optimization can improve the minimum throughput greatly.},

abstract = {With the intensification of urbanization exacerbating ground traffic congestion, the development of low-altitude transportation using electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft has emerged as a novel approach to alleviate urban commuting pressure. This study, taking Shenzhen as a case, extracted commuting demands from census data and determined optimal vertiport locations through K-means clustering and Silhouette function evaluation, revealing that establishing 40 vertiports achieves optimal clustering quality. A genetic algorithm-based minimum operational cost model further demonstrated that battery capacity and charging center quantity are negatively correlated with total flight distance and energy consumption. Specifically, increasing battery capacity within a certain range reduces operational costs through mediating variables, while expanding charging center quantity within a defined threshold decreases energy consumption and costs under fixed battery capacity. This research provides quantitative evidence for low-altitude transportation infrastructure planning and aircraft configuration, proving that optimizing battery capacity and charging network density can effectively enhance the operational cost-effectiveness of urban aerial mobility systems.},

We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear program solution to solve the underlying path planning problem to optimality and provide a more tractable alternative approach. We evaluate our two approaches in extensive simulations using real UAV characteristics and prototype our solution on a physical drone testbed.

Aiming at the problems of traditional algorithms in UAV path planning, such as local optima trapping and low convergence accuracy, this hybrid algorithm combines the advantages of both algorithms. The Fuch and Logistic chaotic maps are used for population initialization to enhance the global search ability. During the optimization process, the DBO algorithm's strong local exploitation ability and the GWO algorithm's global search characteristics are coordinated. A B\'{e}zier curve is employed to smooth the planned path. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid algorithm outperforms traditional algorithms in terms of path length, convergence speed, and path smoothness, validating its effectiveness in UAV three-dimensional path planning.},

However, this approach inherits common limitations associated with machine learning, notably prolonged training periods and limited model adaptability. In the context of addressing path planning for cellular-connected UAVs with the restriction of three-dimensional radio maps, this study initially formulates a problem model to contextualize the challenge and define solution objectives. Subsequently, aligned with this model, a navigation model construction method based on Complex Network theory is introduced for path planning of cellular-connected UAVs. Evaluation results demonstrate that within the same conditions, employing the traditional A* algorithm within our Complex Network based model leads to a significant reduction in signal outage probability compared to the DRL approach. This improvement comes at the cost of a slight increase in path length, while the time required for our model construction is notably shorter than that of DRL.},

abstract = {Maintaining the safety of an autonomous drone while it executes a mission is a primary concern in presence of fixed and mobile enemies. Path planning using A* fails to deliver a feasible, safe plan when a drone has resource limitations in such environments. Enhancing A* with constraint optimization techniques may improve outcomes, but significantly increases path determination time. We define Robust A* (RA*) that introduces the use of a safety margin to maximize the robustness of the drone to meet mission requirements while managing resource restrictions. We rely on a theory of robustness based on Metric Temporal Logic (MTL) as applied to offline verification and online control of hybrid systems. By satisfying the predefined MTL constraints, RA* dynamically defines a safety margin between the drone and an enemy, while constraining the margin size given the drone's resources. The safety margin creates a robust neighborhood around the dynamically generated path. The robust neighborhood holds all valid trajectories within the current world state. When the world state changes, RA* first examines the robust neighborhood to find a valid trajectory before initiating the path re-planning. We evaluate RA* using the Rassim simulator. The results show that the algorithm generates faster and safer paths than the classical A* in the presence of moving enemies..},

abstract = {In military operations, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been heavily utilized in recent years. However, due to the antenna installment regulation, UAVs cannot be controlled by human operators in a restricted area. Hence, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven UAVs are the practical solution to this out-of-coverage problem. With the increased use of autonomous UAVs in military applications, defense systems are deployed to target and shoot down the enemy UAVs in operation. Thus, UAVs are needed to be trained, not only to achieve goals but also to avoid static and dynamic hostile defense systems. In this work, we propose FeD-UP, a federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based UAV path planning framework, that enables UAVs to carry out missions in a hostile environment with a dynamic defense system. The federated learning (FL) based training accelerates the reinforcement learning process and improves model performance. We additionally introduce significant reply memory buffer (SRMB) to quicken the training process more, by selecting the crucial experiences during the training period. The experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed model in controlling UAVs in dynamic, hostile environments.},

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) clusters are widely used in spectrum reconnaissance, where spectrum samples are transmitted back to the sink through flying ad hoc network (FANET). High sampling frequencies are required, but result in a large amount of data not being transmitted over the wireless network, affecting throughput and reliability of the network. The problem boils down to what a good sampling frequency is and how to find it. There is an unknown dynamic sampling frequency threshold, beyond which high packet loss occurs. Prior work focused on achieving higher frequencies through FANET optimization but neglected methods to find this threshold and achieve a maximum value. We propose an adaptive protocol based on binary search. With limited bandwidth and consistent sampling frequency, the protocol dynamically adjusts sampling frequencies in a phased manner at the application layer to maximize the sampling frequency that the network can handle. In addition to spectrum reconnaissance, this protocol can be extended to other applications with consistent sampling frequencies. We have constructed an application based on the EXata simulation platform to analyze the performance of the protocol in delay, stability, reliability, and search times. Simulation results show the protocol improves the efficiency and survivability of spectrum reconnaissance.},

To demonstrate the importance of UAV security once again, real examples of vulnerabilities and dangerous attacks are shown.},

abstract = {The importance of drone use is increasing in all fields due to several characteristics and advantages they provide, such as saving lives, quality imaging, and being easily controllable. In addition, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) prices are going to decrease, this has contributed greatly to an increase in demand for them. However, many challenges face the widespread use of UAVs. One of the most important challenges is his vulnerability to hacking. This paper presents a semi-decentralized collaboration model for the secure measurement of drone positions. The proposed model is based on choosing a leader for each specified period of time by a lightweight consensus algorithm. The leader gets his position using satellites, other drone team members are based on the leader’s safe position to find their locations in a way that is immune to GPS spoofing. Our proposal study shows the extent of the security level it provides against spoofing attacks.},

abstract = {Aiming at the hazards of UAV in the aspects of out-of-control accident and interference with air traffic control, a delay-based forwarding UAV deception jamming method is proposed. By controlling the delay stacking strategy of the forwarding jamming device, the deception position is constructed in real time, the UAV position is pulled off point by point, and the wrong navigation coordinate system is reconstructed to lure the target UAV to fly away from the sensitive area to protect the ground security. Drones are even lured to target areas for capture or shooting down. In this method, the whole UAV deception process is regarded as a time iterative process of single-step position deception pulling. First, the deception position is constructed according to the preset trajectory position and real position of the UAV, and then the optimal delay scheme is obtained through the delay algorithm. After superimposed on the original satellite signal, the position deception is realized through the forwarding jamming device. Finally, the UAV deviates from the preset path to the target area to realize the point-by-point offset deception of the UAV position. The simulation results show that the UAV spoofing method based on time delay can make the target UAV deviate from the original trajectory gradually without being detected, so as to achieve the purpose of satellite navigation spoofing.},

abstract = {Several upcoming 5G and 6G services will rely on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) sending live information to remote terminals in Beyond Visual Line of Sight scenarios. Thus, understanding the traffic flows in these services that might influence end-user experience is key for network operators. One of these services is first person view drone control, consisting on the remote control of the UAV by the live video visualized in a ground control station. This work presents the assembly, integration and evaluation methodology of an UAV quadrotor connected to a wireless network Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network and WiFi radio interfaces. To assess latency, three different connectivity options between UAV and ground control station have been tested, namely connection via LTE server-based, LTE and peer-to-peer WiFi connection. Then, several experiments are carried out to characterize telemetry, control and video traffic for FPV service over the above schemes. Later, a methodology is defined to estimate Quality-of-Experience (QoE) for this service based on objective image quality and latency measurements collected at network and application level. Results show that the QoE assessment methodology introduced in this work is consistent as a basis to define QoE models for cellular network management.},

One of the most notable ones is RF jamming, which can disrupt communication, control, and navigation. While traditional countermeasures, such as Hardware Sandboxing citemead_defeating_2016, or Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on Deep Learning aim to mitigate these threats, they exhibit limitations in addressing sophisticated jamming attacks citedhomane_counter_measures_2020-1. This paper presents a novel design of an authentication-based strategy using RF watermarking. Our proposed RF watermarking technique embeds hidden identifiers within RF signals to authenticate communication sources and detect jamming attempts.

abstract = {Aiming at the problem of poor stability and convergence of the obstacle avoidance algorithm of unmanned aerial vehicles, in order to improve the efficiency of flight missions in complex environments, this study proposes a UAV obstacle avoidance control method that integrates the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm and the artificial potential field (APF) method. Based on the DDPG algorithm, an improved experience replay sampling method is introduced, and the K nearest neighbor (KNN) technology is used to manage and utilize the experience pool data, so that the experience pool can be used more efficiently. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional APF-DDPG algorithm, the average reward value of the proposed DPEPM-KNN algorithm is increased by 21.22%, the path efficiency is increased by 19.61%, and the path stability is increased by 95.6%. In addition, the network loss value fluctuates less and remains at a low level, indicating that the DPEPM-KNN algorithm is superior to the APF-DDPG algorithm in terms of path planning performance, training stability, and network convergence, proving that the proposed method can achieve higher path planning efficiency and lower training loss in complex UAV obstacle avoidance environments.},

The system integrates an onboard computer with a stabilised RGB-D camera and a custom-trained OSTrack pipeline, enabling visual identification under challenging lighting, occlusion, and sea-state conditions. A key innovation is the inter-UAV handoff protocol, which enables seamless transfer of tracking responsibilities between drones, extending operational coverage beyond single-drone battery limitations. Performance is evaluated on a curated shark dataset of 5,200 frames, achieving a tracking success rate of 81.9% during real-time flight control at 100 Hz, and robustness to occlusion, illumination variation, and background clutter. We present a seamless UAV handoff framework, where target transfer is attempted via high-confidence feature matching, achieving 82.9% target coverage. These results confirm the viability of coordinated UAV operations for extended marine tracking and lay the groundwork for scalable, autonomous monitoring.},

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled wirelessly powered Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is emerging as a powerful technology for boosting computational capability and energy supplementation in Internet of Things (IoT). This work addresses the long-term task completion ratio maximization problem in UAV-enabled wirelessly powered MEC systems. Besides the large number of optimization parameters, the environment can only be partially observed as the UAVs cannot cover the whole network area. Then, it is very challenging to obtain good solutions due to the lack of global information. We introduce a novel distributed Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) framework for optimizing UAVs’ actions and resource allocation, considering the constraints of tasks that vary in size, arrival times, and required computation completion time. To decouple the complicated parameters, we divide the problem into two manageable subproblems—UAVs’ action decision and resource allocation under a given UAV’s action. We employ a distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) scheme for the former subproblem to cope with the partially observable nature. By revealing some important properties of the later subproblem, we design an efficient two-stage optimal algorithm to minimize the total consumed energy of nodes while maximizing the task-completing number. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, achieving over a 50% improvement in task completion ratio compared to baseline schemes in some scenarios.},

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation within GPS-denied environments has become increasingly critical in recent years due to modern heavy reliance on GPS and the rise of UAV flight within GPS-denied and GPS-unstable zones. GPS reliance marks on the of the largest weaknesses of most autonomous UAV systems, and the loss of GPS signal often renders many autonomous UAVs completely coordinately-impaired. To confront this issue, this paper presents the implementation of a navigational system based upon dead reckoning and terrain imaging for home-oriented navigation, which is viable even in foreign environments. It explores the possibility of utilizing various forms of image processing, such as feature extraction and matching (SIFT) and optical flow via template matching, in order to replicate similar data that would have otherwise been produced by GPS outputs (namely, confirmation of an estimated final location with real location through image feature comparisons, ground speed calculations from terrain distance movement). This paper uses traditional dead reckoning methods as a path basis for the initial UAV navigation, and it applies both physical implementation and formal methods to study the viability of this solution.},

abstract = {Aviation datalink applications such as&nbsp;controller-pilot datalink communications (CPDLC) and&nbsp;automatic dependent surveillance-contract (ADS-C) were designed to supplement existing communication systems to accommodate increasing air traffic. These applications are typically used to provide departure clearance, en-route services such as altitude and flight plan changes, air traffic surveillance and reporting, and radio frequency assignments. Unlike most attacks proposed so far where the attacker influences decision-making through manipulated instruments, attacks on aviation datalink provide adversaries with a new attack vector to influence the flight crew’s decision-making through direct instructions. In this work, we perform a security analysis of these applications and outline the requirements for executing a successful attack. Specifically, we propose a coordinated multi-aircraft attack and show how an adversary capable of spoofing datalink messages and reactive jamming can influence the flight crew’s decision-making. Through geospatial analysis of historical flight data, we identify 48 vulnerable regions where an attacker has a 90% chance of encountering favorable conditions for coordinated multi-aircraft attacks. Next, we implement a reactive jammer that ensures stealthy attack execution by targeting messages from a specific aircraft with a reaction time of 1.48 ms and 98.85% jamming success. Even though by themselves these attacks have a lower probability of endangering the safety of the aircraft, the threat is magnified when combined with attacks on other avionics. Finally, we discuss the possibility of executing integrated attacks on aircraft system as a whole emphasizing the importance of securing individual components in the aviation ecosystem.},

abstract = {Rotary-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (commonly referred to as drones) are versatile autonomous transportation platforms that can be used for a variety of data collection applications including emergency response, environmental monitoring, surveillance, and many others. In this work, we investigate how to plan efficient paths that minimize mission completion time for drone data collection where the drone must rendezvous with a moving ground vehicle (GV) that cannot stop and wait for the drone. Moreover, we address the limited onboard energy storage issue by adapting drone speed. We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) solution to solve this problem to optimality and provide two heuristics-based alternative solutions (the k-TSP and D-TSP approaches) that are more computationally tractable. We evaluate these approaches in extensive simulations using real drone characteristics to highlight their tradeoffs. Our results show that the k-TSP algorithm performs well when data collection points are closer to the GV, averaging within 4.5% of the optimal solution, while the D-TSP approach is more versatile, finding solutions in situations where the k-TSP algorithm tends to fail. Furthermore, we show that adapting drone speed can improve solution quality by up to 47.1% compared to fixed-speed approaches. In summary, this article serves as an exploratory study in energy-aware planning and scheduling for drones and other autonomous transportation systems.},

A hierarchical game framework based on observation accuracies and channel estimation coefficients is proposed, in which a cooperative attack game (CAG) is modeled to get the optimal joint attack action of multiple AEs by proving CAG is an exact potential game and a Stackelberg game is applied to derive the aerial base station's (ABS's) optimal position according to AEs’ strategies. Then, a hierarchical learning algorithm is proposed to search the ABS's optimal position for enhancing the secrecy rate under the cooperative AEs.

abstract = {Trustworthy artificial intelligence (Trusted AI) is of utmost importance when learning-enabled components (LECs) are used in autonomous, safety-critical systems. When reliant on deep learning, these systems need to address the reliability, robustness, and interpretability of learning models. In addition to developing strategies to address these concerns, appropriate software architectures are needed to coordinate LECs and ensure they deliver acceptable behavior even under uncertain conditions. This work describes Anunnaki, a model-driven framework comprising loosely-coupled modular services designed to monitor and manage LECs with respect to Trusted AI assurance concerns when faced with different sources of uncertainty. More specifically, the Anunnaki framework supports the composition of independent, modular services to assess and improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems. The design of Annunaki was guided by several key software engineering principles (e.g., modularity, composability, and reusability) in order to facilitate its use and maintenance to support different aggregate monitoring and assurance analysis tools for LESs and their respective data sets. We demonstrate Anunnaki on two autonomous platforms, a terrestrial rover, and an unmanned aerial vehicle. Our studies show how Anunnaki can be used to manage the operations of different autonomous learning-enabled systems with vision-based LECs while exposed to uncertain environmental conditions.},

abstract = {This study tackles the vital gaps present in how military education systems train people for UAV reconnaissance. By closely examining the development of drone technology, the uses of military reconnaissance, and the effects on modern warfare, we were able to identify the systemic problems within the current curricula. Our proposed reform combines AI, machine learning (ML), and the analysis of big data. We also incorporate some creative teaching methods like simulation training and project-based learning (PBL). The results show some quite remarkable improvements: the operational readiness has increased by 30%, the mission success rates have hit 90% (compared to an initial 60%), and the decision-making has become 25% quicker. Regarding implementation, it requires allocating resources in stages, conducting faculty development programs, and having strategies to reduce the risks related to adoption. The three-year reform framework includes continuous evaluation and the integration of cross-disciplinary technology to ensure it remains applicable on the battlefield. UAV reconnaissance holds great significance these days. The combination of AI with it has led to numerous changes. When considering curriculum reform in this relevant field, it's crucial to think about how to incorporate elements such as simulation training in a better way. Simulation training can play a vital part in strengthening the understanding and skills related to tactical decision-making. Additionally, swarm technology is an area that simply can't be overlooked. It has an influence on the overall operation and effectiveness. And adaptive learning is another important aspect, which is helpful for making adjustments and improvements according to different situations and requirements.},

abstract = {With global population growth accelerating and food demand rising, the need for efficient farmland surveying to maximize crop yields through precision agriculture has never been more critical. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as capable tools due to their advanced sensor capabilities, high mobility, and ability to collect data with minimal risk to both farmers and crops. While single UAV platforms offer significant potential, their effectiveness remains limited by factors such as restricted battery life, limited flight duration, and high operational costs, among other aspects. This article addresses these limitations by introducing a sensing- and constraint-aware, cooperative coverage framework designed for agricultural surveying using a heterogeneous team of UAVs. Our approach accounts for both the physical constraints of UAVs and the user-defined data collection needs, while minimizing the total mission time and energy consumption. The framework begins by defining the Region of Interest (ROI) as a convex polygon, which is then decomposed into subregions based on the relative sensing and flight capabilities of each UAV. Each partition is assigned to a specific UAV based on its relative capability, and coverage paths are generated using an efficient back-and-forth sweeping strategy. A novel receding horizon Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) technique is then applied to produce collision-free trajectories tailored to each UAV’s constraints. We validated the framework within the CoppeliaSim physics-based simulator, where results demonstrate the effective trajectory coordination and full ROI coverage, confirming the system’s adaptability and performance under realistic conditions. The derived solutions will provide an opportunity for farmers to regularly and efficiently survey agricultural fields to maximize crop yields.},

abstract = {Multi-sensor data fusion technology has improved the positioning accuracy and system stability of multi-UAV formations in complex environments, and has become a mainstream solution. This study integrates data from UWB and Intel RealSense T265 sensors to provide precise positioning information for multi-UAV formations. An improved Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) algorithm is proposed, incorporating adaptive sigma point generation and a dual-layer adaptive covariance adjustment mechanism. This modified algorithm dynamically adjusts the weight of each sensor in the positioning estimation based on the noise characteristics of different sensors, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of high-noise data on positioning accuracy and significantly enhancing overall positioning performance. Experimental results indicate that the improved UKF algorithm, compared to the conventional UKF, enhances positioning accuracy in the x, y, and z directions by 6.78%, 3.29%, and 2.88% respectively in RMSE evaluation, with corresponding reductions in standard deviations by 4.84%, 1.55%, and 7.04%. Particularly in the z direction, the interquartile range (IQR) improvement is notable, with an increase of 7.60%.},

abstract = {Strengthening the position of enterprises, forming high-quality research teams, overcoming key core technologies, and promoting the innovation-driven intrinsic growth of patent-intensive industries are of great importance. This study proposes a method for identifying partners based on a dual-layer network model under the perspective of technology convergence. Within the knowledge network, the method utilizes a patent family citation network to reveal the technology convergence path. By combining technological diversity, path generality, and path novelty, it identifies opportunities for technology convergence along the path. In the social network, the method relies on the technological knowledge status of patentees, assessing the level of complementary and redundant knowledge among patentees to measure the focal company's cooperative and competitive relationships, thus identifying suitable partners. An empirical analysis is conducted using the example of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) tracking telemetry and command system (TT&amp;C system). The research results demonstrate that this method effectively identifies opportunities for technology convergence along the technology convergence path, enabling the selection of partners to form high-quality innovation teams and strengthen industrial control.},

abstract = {Core to drone design is its ability to ascertain its location by utilizing onboard inertial sensors combined with GPS data. However, GPS is not always reachable, especially in challenging environments such as indoors. This paper proposes RaDro; a system that leverages millimeter-waves (mmWave) to precisely localize and track drones in indoor environments. Unlike commonly used alternative technologies, RaDro is cost-effective and can penetrate obstacles, a bonus in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios, which enhances its reliability for tracking objects in complex environments. It does this without the need for tags or anchors to be attached to the drone, achieving 3D tracking with just a single radar point, significantly streamlining the deployment process. Comprehensive experiments are conducted in different scenarios to evaluate RaDro's performance. These include employing different drone models with different sizes to execute a range of aerial manoeuvres across different flight arenas, each with its own settings and clutter, and encountering various LoS and NLoS scenarios in dynamic environments. The experiments aimed to assess the capabilities of the system to extract coarse-grained and fine-grained information for drone detection, motion recognition, and localization. The results showcase precise localization, achieving a 50% reduction in localization error compared to the conventional baseline. This localization accuracy remains resilient even when confronted with interference from other moving sources. The results also demonstrate the system's ability to accurately localize drones in NLoS scenarios where existing state-of-the-art optical technologies cannot work.},

While visual homing and Wide Area Visual Navigation (WAVN) enable lightweight, map-free operation, their effectiveness in large-scale, decentralized settings can be constrained by the absence of a coordination mechanism that accounts for varying reliability across robots. This paper examines the innovative combination of blockchain techniques with WAVN to tackle visual navigation issues in diverse mobile robots used in unstructured sectors like agriculture and forestry. It addresses GPS reliance, adapts to environmental shifts, and reduces computational burdens by integrating RoboStake, a novel blockchain Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism, into the WAVN system. This solution seeks to bolster cooperative navigation by assessing the reliability of each robot's navigational input. With methods including a stake weight function, a PoS consensus score, and a navigability function, this strategy confronts the computational hurdles of coordinating robots and verifying data. Lastly, we showcase how the proposed approach upholds critical navigability features of the WAVN system and present results from scalable simulation experiments to highlight the improved efficiency achieved through enhanced cooperation.},

abstract = {The integration of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted communications has become an effective approach to addressing the challenges of spectrum scarcity, difficulties in equipment setup, and high communication costs in maritime communications. For sake of security and energy consumption issues of UAV-assisted communications, we propose a maritime dual-UAV-assisted cognitive relay communication system in the presence of an unknown-position eavesdropper (Eve). Considering the large-scale time-varying channels of the Marine network and the presence of Eve, one of the UAVs is used to relay information and the other one is used to interfere with Eve. Meanwhile, an error estimation model is employed to approximately estimate the position of Eve. Energy harvesting (EH) under time segmentation (TS) is applied by UAVs with periodic elliptic trajectories to compensate their transmit power for maximizing security energy efficiency (SEE) of the proposed system. Due to complex non-convex constraints and fractional form of objective function of the proposed optimization problem, it is challenging to solve using conventional methods. The Dinkelbach algorithm for fractional transformation and the Lagrangian dual method are introduced to overcome the aforementioned difficulties in solving the problem. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in improving SEE.},

abstract = {The Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) serves as a pivotal element within urban networks, offering decision support to users and connected automated vehicles through comprehensive information gathering, sensing, device control, and data processing. Presently, ITS predominantly relies on sensors embedded in fixed infrastructure, notably Roadside Units (RSUs). However, RSUs are confined by coverage limitations and may encounter challenges in prompt emergency responses. On-demand resources, such as drones, present a viable option to supplement these deficiencies effectively. This article introduces an approach where Software-Defined Networking and Mobile Edge Computing technologies are integrated to formulate a high-availability drone swarm control and communication infrastructure framework comprising the cloud layer, edge layer, and device layer. Drones confront limitations in flight duration attributed to battery limitations, posing a challenge in sustaining continuous monitoring of road conditions over extended periods. Effective drone scheduling stands as a promising solution to overcome these constraints. To tackle this issue, we initially utilized Graph WaveNet, a specialized graph neural network structure tailored for spatial-temporal graph modeling, for training a congestion prediction model using real-world dataset inputs. Building upon this, we further propose an algorithm for drone scheduling based on congestion prediction. Our simulation experiments using real-world data demonstrate that, compared to the baseline method, the proposed scheduling algorithm not only yielded superior scheduling gains but also mitigated drone idle rates.},

abstract = {The traditional drone inspection performed by human operators is unsuited for the purpose of inspecting power transmission lines, because steel towers and their spans are too high and wide to be inspected with a 250 m line of sight. For this reason, the KEPCO Research Institute developed a new inspection drone system that can automatically fly a predetermined flight path based on the GPS coordinates of steel towers, filming a video of power transmission lines with a high definition camera and a thermal imaging camera. In this system, a camera gimbal with the cameras was still controlled by a human operator from a long distance away. When the drone approached close to a steel tower, however, the camera gimbal was often unable to be controlled and real-time video transmission for the gimbal operator was sometimes interrupted due to radio-frequency interference from steel structure and energized power conductors. To solve such a control problem in the field, we also developed an auto-tracking camera gimbal that can automatically track and photograph power facilities on the basis of Deep Learning. With the automatic gimbal, the entire inspection process can be fully automated. The effectiveness of the developed overall system was confirmed through field tests.},

To address the current shortcomings in integrated security performance testing within UAV testing and validation technologies, this paper proposes a MAVLink-based UAV integrated security testing system (MUISTS). Leveraging the good versatility, openness, and wide application of the MAVLink protocol, MUISTS can be quickly integrated into the UAV under test and dynamically load various adverse condition types of test cases as needed. The prototype of MUISTS was implemented in a software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulation environment integrated with Gazebo, Autopilot, and ROS. The results show that MUISTS has characteristics such as comprehensive scene coverage and ease of integration, meeting the requirements for testing and verifying the integrated security performance of UAVs.},

U-space, an European initiative launched in 2016, aims to design and implement a European system for managing and integrating drones in the airspace, as well as a set of services and procedures to guarantee airspace access for a large number of drones. However, the entry of new airspace users and operations brings new concerns, and the increasing risks of cyberattacks are a major factor in the U-space concerns. Indeed, standalone drones inherently introduce new cyber threats that are similar to the ones carried over by autonomous vehicles. Furthermore, U-space involves many highly-exposed Cyber-Physical Systems, with growing vulnerabilities potentially conducting to several threat scenarios and to security incidents affecting public spaces, critical facilities, as well as the citizen’s right to privacy.These considerations lead to the necessity to establish U-space security as a primary challenge and to introduce proper security-by-design approaches. From a research perspective, these result in the adoption of automated security risk assessment for addressing the U-space complexity and for increasing the cost-efficiency of engineering secure U-space systems.Following this direction, this work proposes a preliminary definition of a methodology for the automated security risk assessment of U-space solutions, employing the SESAR Security Risk Assessment Methodology (SecRAM) as a baseline. As a first step, a model-based methodology is investigated for a semi-automatic impact assessment of attacks on U-space assets. Our main contributions are represented by the: definition of criteria to automatically determine and evaluate threat scenarios for U-space solutions; the definition of a U-space Threat Scenario Catalogue, for supporting the automated assessment. Some results are presented for a case study about drone-based pharmaceutical delivery in U-space environment.},

abstract = {When the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is subject to interference, the trustworthiness of satellite navigation positioning results becomes a challenging issue in practical applications. Navigation receivers are vulnerable to natural occlusion and human interference. For natural occlusions that cannot be avoided, error reduction can be achieved by fusion with other sensors. Whereas human interference is more destructive, including suppression interference and spoofing interference, among which spoofing interference has gradually become a major factor affecting satellite quality. Spoofed jamming causes receivers to give false positioning results by faking spoofed signals that are similar to real satellite signals To address the above problems, this paper proposes the use of an inertial/visual system with high interference resistance to assist in the assessment of the confidence of satellite navigation positioning results and reduce the adverse effects of human interference on navigation functions, providing an effective solution to combat satellite interference.},

abstract = {With the increasing technological advancements and deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in different applications (e.g., delivery services, surveillance, critical infrastructure monitoring, military operations, and search-and-rescue operations), a robust, lightweight, and accurate system for UAV state identification and trajectory prediction is becoming a mandate. This work introduces an onboard real-time multi-task learning framework that combines Transformer neural networks and reservoir computing (RC) architectures to enhance outdoor UAV operations. The proposed system employs the Transformer-based architecture to capture the temporal dependencies in sequential data for long-term horizons, while RC-based networks are utilized to ensure robust and real-time performance. Specifically, custom multi-task models are implemented and fine-tuned to collect multi-modal sensor measurements, aiming to enhance the two-fold objective of simultaneous UAV state identification and trajectory prediction through shared feature learning. A dataset comprised of measurements collected from real-world UAV operations (in 3D space) under various conditions is employed to train and evaluate the proposed system. Furthermore, a prototype onboard UAV system is implemented and tested in real-world field experiments. Extensive evaluations of the experimental results demonstrate that the onboard framework achieves accuracy close to the ground truth in both state identification and trajectory prediction, consequently showcasing its potential for practical applications.},

abstract = {This paper introduces LiSWARM, a low-cost LiDAR system to detect and track individual drones in a large swarm. LiSWARM provides robust and precise localization and recognition of drones in 3D space, which is not possible with state-of-the-art drone tracking systems that rely on radio-frequency (RF), acoustic, or RGB image signatures. It includes (1) an efficient data processing pipeline to process the point clouds, (2) robust priority-aware clustering algorithms to isolate swarm data from the background, (3) a reliable neural network-based algorithm to recognize the drones, and (4) a technique to track the trajectory of every drone in the swarm. We develop the LiSWARM prototype and validate it through both in-lab and field experiments. Notably, we measure its performance during two drone light shows involving 150 and 500 drones and confirm that the system achieves up to 98% accuracy in recognizing drones and reliably tracking drone trajectories. To evaluate the scalability of LiSWARM, we conduct a thorough analysis to benchmark the system's performance with a swarm consisting of 15,000 drones. The results demonstrate the potential to leverage LiSWARM for other applications, such as battlefield operations, errant drone detection, and securing sensitive areas such as airports and prisons.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising technology to provide low-latency mobile edge computing (MEC) services. To fully utilize the potential of UAV-assisted MEC in practice, both technical and economic challenges need to be addressed: how to optimize UAV trajectory for online task offloading and incentivize the participation of UAVs without compromising the privacy of user equipment (UE). In this work, we consider unique features of UAVs, i.e., high mobility as well as limited energy and computing capacity, and propose privacy-preserving auction frameworks, Ptero, to schedule offloading tasks on the fly and incentivize UAVs’ participation. Specifically, Ptero first decomposes the online task offloading problem into a series of one-round problems by scaling the UAV’s energy constraint into the objective. To protect UE’s privacy, Ptero calculates UAV’s coverage based on subset-anonymity. At each round, Ptero schedules UAVs greedily, computes remuneration for working UAVs, and processes unserved tasks in the cloud to maximize the system’s utility (i.e., minimize social cost). Theoretical analysis proves that Ptero achieves truthfulness, individual rationality, computational efficiency, privacy-preserving and a nontrivial competitive ratio. Trace-driven evaluations further verify that Ptero can reduce the social cost by up to 116% compared with four state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of communication infrastructure and the widespread of IoT computing facilities such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), the application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly growing especially in last-mile deliveries in smart logistics. However, the anomaly detection in the MEC environment is still one yet unresolved issue. In recent years, the methods of UAV anomaly detection mainly focus on detections of specific types of UAVs or a certain feature of UAVs, and it is not as certain to achieve efficient and reliable results, in other words, there is currently a lack of better ways to address security issues in UAV networks. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Featured Anomaly Detection (MFAD) method for MEC-based UAV delivery systems to detect malicious attacks in the network through the abnormal state of UAV. Firstly, we develop deep learning model to recognize the correct UAV behaviors using several common UAV data in normal states, including altitude and speed. Secondly, we apply attacks in the data to simulate anomalous UAV behaviors under cyberattacks. Thirdly, the abnormal data is merged into the selected normal behavior model to detect the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) between the input data and the data provided by the normal behavior model. Finally, experiments with UAV sensor data demonstrate that our method is effective in detecting anomalies, but also reduce the vital energy consumption in UAV delivery systems.},

abstract = {A seamless communication capability is important in military operations. Likewise, enhanced security, increased capacity, and robust communication mechanisms are vital for humanitarian and disaster-response operations. Often, a system of wide-band satellites is employed for real-time exchange of information and over-the-horizon control, but the communications are prone to denial of service (DoS) attacks, and delayed redeployment. Hence, a swarm of drones could be deployed in mission-critical operations in times of urgency for a secured and robust distributed-intercommunication which is essential for survivability and successful completion of missions. In this paper, a distributed-agent-based framework for secure and reliable information exchange between drones in a constellation is proposed. The framework comprises a mechanism for path planning simulation and estimation, a flexible network architecture for improved client-server(C/S) and peer-to-peer (P2P) connectivity, as well as agents for identity authentications and secure communications. The framework has been simulated and verified with results showing promise.},

This article presents a novel Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) framework, named HEROES, which leverages the UAV and integrated sensing and communication technologies to address the challenges in post-disaster environments. Our approach focuses on a comprehensive post-disaster scenario involving multiple victims, first responders, UAVs, and an emergency control center. HEROES enables UAVs to function as anchor nodes and facilitate the precise positioning of the victims while simultaneously collecting critical data from the disaster area. We further introduce a reinforcement learning model based on the Optimistic Q-learning with Upper Confidence Bound algorithm, enabling the victims and first responders to autonomously select the most advantageous UAV connections based on their channel gain, shadowing probability, and positional characteristics. Furthermore, HEROES is based on a satisfaction game-theoretic model to enhance the sensing, communication, and positioning functionalities. Our analysis reveals the existence of various satisfaction equilibria, including minimum efficient satisfaction equilibrium, ensuring that the UAVs meet their quality of service constraints at minimal operational costs. Extensive experimental results validate the scalability and performance of HEROES, demonstrating significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods in delivering PNT services during humanitarian emergencies.},

Secondly, a feature point screening and matching strategy is constructed, by which common feature points between heterogeneous remote sensing images can be screened and used for feature matching. Finally, the remote sensing image containing geographic location information and the UAV aerial image are fed into the network for feature extraction and matching, and the transformation matrix between the aligned images is calculated by the successfully matched feature points, and the transformation matrix is used to complete the mapping from the aerial image to the satellite image, and finally the geographic location information of each pixel can be read from the mapped image to complete the localization.},

abstract = {In the last decades, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are finding more and more fields of application. Their flexibility and cost-efficiency make them useful to support complex operations in agriculture, remote sensing or construction, just to name a few. In the Labyrinth project we aim at investigating the applicability of UAV usage to critical scenarios like air, water and road traffic control or emergency, with a strict focus on safety, security and efficiency. This involves also the cybersecurity aspect, which is the main focus of this work. UAVs used in critical applications are in fact potentially exposed to a wide set of cyber threats. The NIST cybersecurity framework [17] defines five different security functions which are: identify, protect, detect, respond and recover. In this paper we address the identify and detect functions with an approach involving threat analysis and anomaly detection. Firstly, we identify which threats pose a significant risk to the Labyrinth use case, for instance leading to the collision of UAVs in case an attacker is successful. Secondly, we present a machine learning-based pipeline aimed at detecting deviations in the position reportings of the drone, to support the detect function during flight operations. The pipeline is tailored to the Labyrinth system reporting needs and is based on unsupervised machine learning to overcome the lack of labeled data.

abstract = {We present HUM-High-frequency UAV Messaging: an acoustic side channel communication system we design for localized drone-to-drone communications. We generate Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signals from drone motors to carry information and improve communication reliability by mitigating propeller noise interference through modifications to the propeller's physical design. These modifications reduce propeller noise in the designated acoustic spectrum by up to 7 dB. We deploy a custom ultrasonic microphone shield specifically designed for decoding in the receiver. HUM's improved signal-to-noise ratio enables up to 80x higher data rates compared to the existing design from the literature while providing better scalability. HUM supports simultaneous decoding across 16 drones within 8 m, range as seen in real flight tests. The cost of this performance is minimal; we experimentally demonstrate that HUM has a marginal impact on flight dynamics and battery life.},

abstract = {Shared control is an emerging interaction paradigm in which a human and an AI partner collaboratively control a system. Shared control unifies human and artificial intelligence, making the human’s interactions with computers more accessible, safe, precise, effective, creative, and playful. This form of interaction has independently emerged in contexts as varied as mobility assistance, driving, surgery, and digital games. These domains each have their own problems, terminology, and design philosophies. Without a common language for describing interactions in shared control, it is difficult for designers working in one domain to share their knowledge with designers working in another. To address this problem, we present a dimension space for shared control, based on a survey of 55 shared control systems from six different problem domains. This design space analysis tool enables designers to classify existing systems, make comparisons between them, identify higher-level design patterns, and imagine solutions to novel problems.},

abstract = {Autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed nowadays, thanks to the additional features and enhanced flexibility they provide, e.g., for transportation and goods delivery. On the one hand, discovering in advance collisions occurring with other UAVs in the future could enhance the efficiency of the path planning, reducing further the delivery time and UAVs’ energy consumption. On the other hand, location and timestamps–key to detecting and avoiding collisions in advance–are sensitive and cannot be shared indiscriminately with untrusted entities. This paper solves the aforementioned challenging problem by proposing PPTM, a new protocol for efficient and effective privacy-preserving trajectory matching on autonomous UAVs. PPTM allows two UAVs, possibly not connected to the Internet, to discover any spatial and temporal collisions in their future paths, without revealing to the other party anything else than the colliding time and coordinates. To this aim, PPTM grounds on a dedicated tree-based algorithm, namely, Incremental Capsule Matching, tailored to the unique features of spatio-temporal data, and it also integrates a lightweight privacy-preserving proximity testing solution for performing private comparisons. We tested our solution on real devices with heterogeneous processing capabilities (a regular laptop, a tiny processing unit, and a mini-drone), showing that PPTM can perform privacy-preserving trajectory matching even in a few milliseconds, up to 98.27% quicker compared to the most efficient competing solution.},

D2D communication, which make full use of spectrum resources and create low-cost communication opportunities among devices has recently attracted considerable attention.

We have performed extensive experiments on real-world trajectory data of two-year including 7080 vessels. The experiment results demonstrate that OceanNet can achieve 67.91% average delivery ratio with average delay 40.98 minutes without the help of satellites and other specific auxiliary communication equipment, which has preliminarily verified the feasibility of the architecture. Finally, we give a further discussion of the future research directions in this field.},

abstract = {Discovering mutual proximity and avoiding collisions is one of the most critical services needed by the next generation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, currently available solutions either rely on sharing mutual locations, neglecting the location privacy of involved parties, or are applicable for fully autonomous vehicles only—leaving unaddressed Remotely-Piloted UAVs’ safety needs. Alternatively, proximity can be discovered by adding sensing capabilities. However, in addition to the cost of the sensors, the complexity of integration, and the toll on the energy budget, the effectiveness of such solutions is usually limited by short detection ranges, making them hardly useful in high-mobility scenarios. In this paper, we propose LPPD (an acronym for Lightweight Privacy-preserving Proximity Discovery), a unique solution for privacy-preserving proximity discovery among remotely piloted UAVs based on the exchange of wireless messages. LPPD integrates two main building blocks: (i) a custom space tessellation technique based on randomized spheres; and, (ii) a lightweight cryptographic primitive for private-set intersection. Another feature enjoyed by LPPD is that it does not require online third parties. LPPD is rooted in sound theoretical results and is supported by an experimental assessment performed on a real drone. In particular, experimental results show that LPPD achieves 100% proximity discovery while taking only 39.66&nbsp;milliseconds in the most lightweight configuration and draining only the 5 · 10− 6% of the UAV’s battery capacity. In addition, LPPD’s security properties are formally verified.},

A designed experiment was conducted to determine the impact of grid parameters on operational effectiveness metrics and computational costs.

abstract = {Automated Driving Systems (ADS) have made great achievements in recent years thanks to the efforts from both academia and industry. A typical ADS is composed of multiple modules, including sensing, perception, planning, and control, which brings together the latest advances in different domains. Despite these achievements, safety assurance of ADS is of great significance, since unsafe behavior of ADS can bring catastrophic consequences. Testing has been recognized as an important system validation approach that aims to expose unsafe system behavior; however, in the context of ADS, it is extremely challenging to devise effective testing techniques, due to the high complexity and multidisciplinarity of the systems. There has been great much literature that focuses on the testing of ADS, and a number of surveys have also emerged to summarize the technical advances. Most of the surveys focus on the system-level testing performed within software simulators, and they thereby ignore the distinct features of different modules. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on the existing ADS testing literature, which takes into account both module-level and system-level testing. Specifically, we make the following contributions: (1) We survey the module-level testing techniques for ADS and highlight the technical differences affected by the features of different modules; (2) we also survey the system-level testing techniques, with focuses on the empirical studies that summarize the issues occurring in system development or deployment, the problems due to the collaborations between different modules, and the gap between ADS testing in simulators and the real world; and (3) we identify the challenges and opportunities in ADS testing, which pave the path to the future research in this field.},

abstract = {In the past decade, the vulnerability of aircraft communications against low-resourced attackers has received significant attention both in the information security community and from aviation industry and regulators. Until now, research on attacks against such communications technologies has focused on larger aircraft, neglecting the technologies used in light aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). As such lighter aircraft make up a large and growing majority of both airspace users and casualties, this is a glaring oversight from a security and safety perspective.To alleviate this problem, we conduct a first comprehensive security analysis of the FLARM ecosystem, a collision avoidance system focusing on light aircraft and UAV with a large and increasing distribution in many countries. Besides being used in more than 40,000 aircraft, several large providers of air traffic data capture the unauthenticated FLARM data using ground receivers in order to feed crucial downstream applications.To show the vulnerability of this ecosystem, we design, implement and evaluate a practical spoofing attack, which is capable of interacting with FLARM receivers in the air and on the ground. The demonstrated attack uses low-cost hardware and open-source software and is as such accessible to a wide range of threat actors, resulting in a significant potential impact on the safety of all airspace users. Finally, in order to counter such attacks, we propose a first anomaly detection approach based on physical-layer characteristics and validate it with real-world aircraft data.},

abstract = {With the rise in the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), security concerns associated with them have become paramount. Similar to other cyber-physical systems, the primary working principle behind UAVs follows the sensor-controller-actuation cycle. Errors between the setpoints and sensor data are computed through a PID controller and translated to pulse width modulated (PWM) signals that control the orientation and movement of a UAV. Recent research has demonstrated intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI)-based alteration of PWM signals causing unauthorized maneuvers and crashes in UAVs. PWM alteration attacks can be carried out in various ways. For instance, hardware Trojans (HTs) can manipulate the PWM signals, and given the untrusted supply chain, HTs are a critical threat. Adversaries can exploit the PWM signals to manipulate UAV operations subtly, bypassing traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that only monitor sensor data. Therefore, ensuring the integrity of PWM signals and their correlation with sensor and controller data is crucial for end-to-end UAV security. We address this need by proposing ConFIDe (Control-Fused Intrusion Detection system), a novel defense technique for UAVs. It verifies the integrity of the flight controller-generated PWM signals, ensuring the motors receive the signals free from hidden exploits. We validated our proposed IDS on different PWM alteration attack scenarios. In particular, we implemented a hardware Trojan attack targeting the PWM signals on a PX4-UAV to test the efficacy of the proposed IDS on a real system. ConFIDe performed well on all the attack scenarios, achieving a high ROC-AUC, including sensor attacks like GPS spoofing.},

abstract = {Because of its cost effectiveness and timeliness, package delivery using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), called drone delivery, is drawing growing attention. Authentication is critical for ensuring that a package is not picked up by an attacker's drone or delivered to an attacker. As delivery drones are costly and may carry sensitive or expensive packages, a drone should not get very close to a person unless she is authenticated; thus, conventional authentication approaches that require human-drone physical contact do not work. Existing authentication methods for drone delivery suffer from one or multiple of the following limitations: (1) requiring special user-side hardware; (2) enforcing one-way authentication only; (3) being vulnerable to relay attacks; (4) having compatibility issues. We present the first system, named Greet-to-Auth (G2Auth, for short), that supports mutual authentication between a user and a drone, without these limitations. A user waves her hand holding a smartphone to conduct the authentication. The evaluation shows that it is secure, accurate, usable, and robust.},

abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in our daily lives. However, like many other complex systems, UAVs are susceptible to software bugs that can lead to abnormal system behaviors and undesirable consequences. It is crucial to study such software bug-induced UAV anomalies, which are often manifested in flight logs, to help assure the quality and safety of UAV systems. However, there has been limited research on investigating the code-level patterns of software bug-induced UAV anomalies. This impedes the development of effective tools for diagnosing and localizing bugs within UAV system code.To bridge the research gap and deepen our understanding of UAV anomalies, we carried out an empirical study on this subject. We first collected 178 real-world abnormal logs induced by software bugs in two popular open-source UAV platforms, i.e., PX4 and Ardupilot. We then examined each of these abnormal logs and compiled their common patterns. In particular, we investigated the most severe anomalies that led to UAV crashes, and identified their features. Based on our empirical findings, we further summarized the challenges of localizing bugs in system code by analyzing anomalous UAV flight data, which can offer insights for future research in this field.},

abstract = {Visual and inertial navigation have obvious complementarity in navigation accuracy, and the combined navigation of the two has excellent anti-interference ability. In this paper, a visual-inertial-based satellite quality evaluation method is proposed. This method can judge whether the GPS (Global Positioning System) is interfered by comparing the visual-inertial navigation information with the GPS data information in the geographic coordinate system. This method enables the UAV to quickly switch the navigation mode under the condition of being disturbed, which ensures that the navigation function is accurate and free from interference, and provides a more solid foundation for the navigation of the UAV and other platforms.},

abstract = {We propose a novel human-swarm interaction system, allowing the user to directly control a swarm of drones in a complex environment through trajectory drawing with a hand gesture interface based on the DNN-based gesture recognition. The developed CV-based system allows the user to control the swarm behavior without additional devices through human gestures and motions in real-time, providing convenient tools to change the swarm’s shape and formation. The two types of interaction were proposed and implemented to adjust the swarm hierarchy: trajectory drawing and free-form trajectory generation control. The experimental results revealed a high accuracy of the gesture recognition system (99.75%), allowing the user to achieve relatively high precision of the trajectory drawing (mean error of 5.6 cm in comparison to 3.1 cm by mouse drawing) over the three evaluated trajectory patterns. The proposed system can be potentially applied in complex environment exploration, spray painting using drones, and interactive drone shows, allowing users to create their own art objects by drone swarms.},

abstract = {The growing surge in urban-crime rate represents a global complex endemic that is beyond the immediate capability of the policing apparatus of nations. This trend is particularly prevalent in urban cities in developing nations, where crime-rate exhibits dynamic tendencies in contrast to the static policing apparatus being deployed. Thus, the policing apparatus in urban cities in developing nations often play catchups with crime; a phenomenon that further elicits crime complexity. As a way to ameliorate this societal menace, this study evaluates probable practical approaches that can be integrated into the modern policing modality in developing nations. The approach considers the development of a dynamic surveillance management system that considers the contextual peculiarity of developing nations. Through the use of a self-administered measurement instrument from Police respondents in developing nations, the implementation feasibility and the probable effectiveness of the proposition will be further evaluated. From the preliminary result from sampled Police officers, this practical approach could present a complementary paradigm that can leverage modern technology towards an effective urban-policing mechanism. Furthermore, this approach presents modalities for the maximization of the human capacity of the Policing service, as well as the management of policing response-rate in developing nations.},

abstract = {The consumer drone market is booming. Consumer drones are predominantly used for aerial photography; however, their use has been expanding because of their autopilot technology. Unfortunately, terrorists have also begun to use consumer drones for kamikaze bombing and reconnaissance. To protect against such threats, several companies have started “anti-drone” services that primarily focus on disrupting or incapacitating drone operations. However, the approaches employed are inadequate, because they make any drone that has intruded stop and remain over the protected area. We specify this issue by introducing the concept of safe-hijacking, which enables a hijacker to expel the intruding drone from the protected area remotely. As a safe-hijacking strategy, we investigated whether consumer drones in the autopilot mode can be hijacked via adaptive GPS spoofing. Specifically, as consumer drones activate GPS fail-safe and change their flight mode whenever a GPS error occurs, we performed black- and white-box analyses of GPS fail-safe flight mode and the following behavior after GPS signal recovery of existing consumer drones. Based on our analyses results, we developed a taxonomy of consumer drones according to these fail-safe mechanisms and designed safe-hijacking strategies for each drone type. Subsequently, we applied these strategies to four popular drones: DJI Phantom 3 Standard, DJI Phantom 4, Parrot Bebop 2, and 3DR Solo. The results of field experiments and software simulations verified the efficacy of our safe-hijacking strategies against these drones and demonstrated that the strategies can force them to move in any direction with high accuracy.},

abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), better known as drones, have significantly advanced fields such as aerial surveillance, military reconnaissance, cadastral surveying, disaster monitoring, and delivery services. However, UAVs rely on civilian (unauthenticated) GPS for navigation which can be trivially spoofed. In this paper, we present DeepSIM, a satellite imagery matching approach to detect GPS spoofing attacks against UAVs based on deep learning. We make use of the camera(s) a typical UAV is equipped with, and present a system that compares historical satellite images of its GPS-based position (spaceborne photography) with real-time aerial images from its cameras (airborne imagery). Historical images are taken from, e.&nbsp;g., Google Earth or NASA WorldWind. To detect GPS spoofing attacks, we investigate different deep neural network models that compare the real-time camera images with the historical satellite images. To train and test the models, we have constructed the SatUAV dataset (consisting of 967 image pairs), partially by using real UAVs such as the DJI Phantom 4 Advanced. Real-world experimental results show that our best model has a success rate of about 95% in detecting GPS spoofing attacks within less than 100 milliseconds. Our approach does not require any modification of the existing GPS infrastructures and relies only on public satellite imagery, making it a practical solution for many everyday scenarios.},

Given the huge advantages and broad application prospects of laser weapons in counter-UAVs, this article investigates the relationship between power density and beam duration when the UAV shell was damaged, based on the analysis of the mechanism and effects of laser thermal damage, mechanical damage and radiation damage. Besides, the time required for the damage of the UAV shell was specifically analyzed. Given the large size and power consumption of laser weapons, we need to evaluate the problem of ship-borne laser weapon integration. Take the Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) as an example, the feasibility of integrating laser weapons into it was evaluated from the aspects of ship space and power supply, then assessed whether it will affect the ship's other performance. The results show that, in the future, the laser weapons installed on large ships can be applied to counter-UAVs. The above model serves as a method for evaluating the combat effectiveness of high-energy laser weapons and provides a reference for high-energy laser weapons to counter-UAVs.},

abstract = {Thanks to flexible deployment and excellent maneuverability, autonomous drones have been recently considered as an effective means to act as aerial data relays for wireless ground devices with limited or no cellular infrastructure, e.g., smart farming in a remote area. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, data communications between the drones and the ground devices are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. This article develops BloothAir, which is a secure multi-hop aerial relay system based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connected autonomous drones. For encrypting the BLE communications in BloothAir, a channel-based secret key generation is proposed, where received signal strength at the drones and the ground devices is quantized to generate the secret keys. Moreover, a dynamic programming-based channel quantization scheme is studied to minimize the secret key bit mismatch rate of the drones and the ground devices by recursively adjusting the quantization intervals. To validate the design of BloothAir, we build a multi-hop aerial relay testbed by using the MX400 drone platform and the Gust radio transceiver, which is a new lightweight onboard BLE communicator specially developed for the drone. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that the BloothAir system achieves a significantly lower secret key bit mismatch rate than the key generation benchmarks, which use the static quantization intervals. In addition, the high randomness of the generated secret keys is verified by the standard NIST test, thereby effectively protecting the BLE communications in BloothAir from the eavesdropping attacks.},

abstract = {Australia has witnessed heavy wildfires since 2019, which were especially serious in eastern Victoria. What's worse, climate change can make situations more serious. Surprisingly the unmanned drones can help a lot in dealing with wildfires, which are divided into two types: one for surveillance and situation awareness (SSA) and another for extending the communication range limited by circumstances. This paper aims to provide purchase and deployment plans of both kinds of drones to the government of Victoria taking the fires on one of the mountains as examples. To achieve that, we establish three models. Firstly, a multi-objective programming model is used to make the plan reasonable comprehensively. Considering the safety of firemen, mutual interference of different drones, and consumption of drones, we build the model to study the best solution under constraints. After learning the basic size and frequency of wildfires in Victoria, we can construct the drones' system better. The second model is established to optimize the locations of repeater drones. We take our basic assumptions into consideration and put forward the possible locations of repeater drones. Based on new assumptions, we obtain the optimal results of repeater drones. The third model is established to obtain the patrol route of SSA drones, considering the safety of firemen and the capability of drones, then SSA drones' number and patrol mode are confirmed through boustrophedon decomposition. Then we can make the cost of the wildfire rescue system minimum.},

abstract = {Recent geopolitical events have exposed our critical dependence on the wireless infrastructure used to facilitate worldwide communication. State-sponsored groups are actively attacking and exploiting space-based communication networks, causing outages and serious economic damage. Despite initial research findings pointing out a lack of security, such networks enjoy growing adoption and are still placed at the heart of today's communication infrastructure, ranging form the transportation sector over oil rigs to consumer internet. Worryingly, the command and control networks that support this satellite-based communication have received little attention from the security community so far.This paper addresses this research gap and conducts a systematic security assessment of the Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) ecosystem. More specifically, we investigate the attack surface of the underlying command and control networks and analyze the systems currently used by industry-leading vendors. Through systematic reverse engineering, we uncover a number of wide-reaching vulnerabilities that illustrate the perilous position of the satellite industry. We then systematically formulate a phase-based threat model to categorize these issues and uncover several inherently insecure design practices.},

This framework adopts deep reinforcement learning modelling by using the supervised learning and the Deep Q-Network (DQN) methods. As a proof of concept, we built an autonomous decision-making training scenario based on the Weapon Effectiveness Simulation System (WESS).

abstract = {Small uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) provide an invaluable resource for performing a variety of surveillance, search, and delivery tasks in remote or hostile terrains which may not be accessible by other means. Due to the critical role sUAS play in these situations, it is vital that they are well configured in order to ensure a safe and stable flight. However, it is not uncommon for mistakes to occur in configuration and calibration, leading to failures or incomplete missions. To address this problem, we propose a set of self-adaptive mechanisms and implement them into a self-adaptive framework, Controller Instability-preventing Configuration-Aware Drone Adaptation (CICADA). CICADA dynamically detects unstable drone behavior during flight and adapts to mitigate this threat. We have built a prototype of CICADA using a popular open source sUAS flight control software and experimented with a large number of different configurations in simulation. We then performed a case study with physical drones to determine if our framework will work in practice. Experimental results show that CICADA’s adaptations reduce controller instability and enable the sUAS to recover from up to 33.8% of poor configurations. In cases where we cannot complete the intended mission, invoking alternative adaptations may still help by allowing the vehicle to loiter or land safely in place, avoiding potentially catastrophic crashes. These safety-focused adaptations can mitigate unsafe behavior in 52.9% to 64.7% of dangerous configurations. We further show that rule-based approaches can be leveraged to automatically select an appropriate adaptation strategy based on the severity of instability encountered, with up to a 14.2% improvement over direct adaptation. Finally, we introduce a variation of our primary adaptation strategy designed to allow more cautious adaptation with limited configuration information, which gets within 6.7% of our primary adaptation strategy despite not requiring an optimal knowledge base.},

abstract = {There has been rapid growth in the use of machine learning (ML) software in emerging edge and IoT systems. ML software deployments enable analytics and pattern recognition for multi-modal data (e.g., audio, images/video, wireless signals, air quality) obtained from embedded sensors and transceivers. However, resource constraints in edge and IoT platforms make it challenging to meet quality-of-service and real-time goals. The growing complexity of ML also exacerbates these issues. We discuss the challenges of ML software deployment in edge and IoT platforms, present strategies to ease deployment, and discuss case studies from the automotive, indoor navigation, and hardware/software co-design domains.},

abstract = {Robotic Autonomous Vehicles (RAVs) rely on their sensors for perception, and follow strict mission specifications (e.g., altitude, speed, and geofence constraints) for safe and timely operations. Physical attacks can corrupt the RAVs' sensors, resulting in mission failures. Recovering RAVs from such attacks demands robust control techniques that maintain compliance with mission specifications even under attacks to ensure the RAV's safety and timely operations.We propose SpecGuard, a technique that complies with mission specifications and performs safe recovery of RAVs. There are two innovations in SpecGuard. First, it introduces an approach to incorporate mission specifications and learn a recovery control policy using Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep-RL). We design a compliance-based reward structure that reflects the RAV's complex dynamics and enables SpecGuard to satisfy multiple mission specifications simultaneously. Second, SpecGuard incorporates state reconstruction, a technique that minimizes attack induced sensor perturbations. This reconstruction enables effective adversarial training, and optimizing the recovery control policy for robustness under attacks. We evaluate SpecGuard in both virtual and real RAVs, and find that it achieves 92% recovery success rate under attacks on different sensors, without any crashes or stalls. SpecGuard achieves 2X higher recovery success than prior work, and incurs about 15% performance overhead on real RAVs.},

abstract = {The advent of Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) has enabled the feasibility of wireless sensor networks for environmental traffic sensing across urban areas. In this study, we explore the usage of LoRaWAN end nodes as traffic sensing sensors to offer a practical traffic management solution. The monitored Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) factor is reported and used in the gateways to assess the traffic of the environment. Our technique utilizes LoRaWAN as a long-range communication technology to provide a large-scale system. In this work, we present a method of using LoRaWAN devices to estimate traffic flows. LoRaWAN end devices then transmit their packets to different gateways. Their RSSI will be affected by the number of cars present on the roadway. We used SVM and clustering methods to classify the approximate number of cars present. This paper details our experiences with the design and real implementation of this system across an area that stretches for miles in urban scenarios. We continuously measured and reported RSSI at different gateways for weeks. Results have shown that if a LoRaWAN end node is placed in an optimal position, up to 96% of correct environment traffic level detection can be obtained. Additionally, we share the lessons learned from such a deployment for traffic sensing.},

abstract = {The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a system that provides position information such as latitude, longitude, and altitude anywhere on the earth. If this system is used, however, it may cause (1) position acquisition interruptions in places where GPS signals do not reach, (2) increased power consumption due to the constant processing of numerous satellite signals, and (3) cyber-attacks targeting GPS receivers. Until now, many methods have been proposed to overcome these challenges individually. This study, in contrast, addresses these challenges simultaneously for the quadcopter (abbreviated as drone) case, where the use of GPS is a prerequisite. Drones used in logistics, agriculture, surveillance, and other industrial fields are transitioning from manual operation to autopilot due to geographic expansion of services and reduction of labor costs. This study uses Perceiver, the latest deep-learning model, to track a autopilot drone from takeoff to current position in real time by using signals roll, pitch, yaw, and throttle. We call the four signals Manual Operation Representation (MOR) because a drone can be manually controlled with a radio controller that transmits the four signals. Our method can complement GPS at any time and can detect a malfunction or cyber-attack if the flight route calculated by the deep-learning model deviates from the route specified by the autopilot.},

This approach streamlines user interaction, reducing cognitive load and enhancing engagement. Our evaluations demonstrate EchoSight’s effectiveness for room-scale communication, achieving distances up to 5 m and viewing angles up to 120 degrees.

abstract = {Micro-gesture recognition using wearable devices is an important research topic in human-computer interaction. Surface electromyography (sEMG) is widely researched for gesture recognition due to its ability to capture muscle signals that precede actual gestures. Most existing methods are based on artificial neural networks (ANN), which may lead to high latency, high power consumption, and high memory usage when deployed on wearable devices. We propose a deep compressed spiking neural network (DCSNN) to address the challenges. The DCSNN can significantly reduce the inference power consumption and memory usage while improving recognition accuracy. In addition, we designed a linear method of action detection called leaky integrate-and-fire for transient-state action detection (TAD-LIF), which can improve the robustness of recognition systems effectively. To evaluate our method, we developed two lightweight sEMG wristbands respectively for two interaction modes, and collected two datasets from about 40 subjects. The experiment results show that DCSNN had a higher recognition accuracy than existing methods with values of 88.55% and 95.76% on the two datasets. In addition, its inference latency, power consumption, and memory usage are only about 0.4%, 0.05%, and 2% of those of popular convolutional neural network (CNN) methods. Our method enables precise, high-speed, and low-power micro-gesture recognition on a plethora of resource-constrained consumer-level intelligent wearable devices.},

abstract = {With the increasing scale of offshore wind farm development, maintaining farms efficiently and safely becomes a necessity. The length of turbine downtime and the logistics for human technician transfer make up a significant proportion of the operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs. To reduce such costs, future O&amp;M infrastructures will increasingly rely on offshore autonomous robotic solutions that are capable of co-managing wind farms with human operators located onshore. In particular, unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous surface vessels, and crawling robots are expected to play important roles not only to bring down costs but also to significantly reduce the health and safety risks by assisting (or replacing) human operators in performing the most hazardous tasks. This paper portrays a visionary view in which heterogeneous robotic assets, underpinned by AI agent technology, coordinate their behavior to autonomously inspect, maintain and repair offshore wind farms over long periods of time and unstable weather conditions. They cooperate with onshore human operators, who supervise the mission at a distance, via the use of shared deliberation techniques. We highlight several challenging research directions in this context and offer ambitious ideas to tackle them as well as initial solutions.},

abstract = {Drones are breaking away from their role as recreational toys and are emerging as trusted delivery systems and tools for law enforcement. This new role makes them targets of midair attacks for profit and vandalism. Despite tremendous advancement in robotic navigation and control, drones are still vulnerable to collisions with dynamic objects. While projectile detection and direction-of-arrival estimation techniques are mature in theory and fully functional in modern aircrafts' defense systems, these solutions could not make their ways to these resource-constrained flying robots. We envision to develop an ecosystem of lightweight and low-power defense modules for small drones. This paper explores the viability of this vision and as a proof of concept, develops a single microphone-based acoustic sensing mechanism capable of identifying the direction of approaching projectiles thrown at the drone. Experiments on the developed prototype of the sensing systems show perfect accuracy for detecting cases where a dynamic object is about to hit the drone. The low latency of our system detects an approaching object around 100 ms before the event giving sufficient time for the drone to dodge it. Despite being far from a complete defense solution, our prototype bolsters the possibility of developing sensing-inferencing modules for extreme resource-constrained scenarios.},

abstract = {The camera is one of the most important sensors for an autonomous vehicle (AV) to perform Environment Perception and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). To secure the camera, current autonomous vehicles not only utilize the data gathered from multiple sensors (e.g., Camera, Ultrasonic Sensor, Radar, or LiDAR) for environment perception and SLAM but also require the human driver to always realize the driving situation, which can effectively defend against previous attack approaches (i.e., creating visible fake objects or introducing perturbations to the camera by using advanced deep learning techniques). Different from their work, in this paper, we in-depth investigate the features of Infrared light and introduce a new security challenge called I-Can-See-the-Light- Attack (ICSL Attack) that can alter environment perception results and introduce SLAM errors to the AV. Specifically, we found that the invisible infrared lights (IR light) can successfully trigger the image sensor while human eyes cannot perceive IR lights. Moreover, the IR light appears magenta color in the camera, which triggers different pixels from the ambient visible light and can be selected as key points during the AV's SLAM process. By leveraging these features, we explore to i) generate invisible traffic lights, ii) create fake invisible objects, iii) ruin the in-car user experience, and iv) introduce SLAM errors to the AV. We implement the ICSL Attack by using off-the-shelf IR light sources and conduct an extensive evaluation on Tesla Model 3 and an enterprise-level autonomous driving platform under various environments and settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the ICSL Attack and prove that current autonomous vehicle companies have not yet considered the ICSL Attack, which introduces severe security issues. To secure the AV, by exploring unique features of the IR light, we propose a software-based detection module to defend against the ICSL Attack.},

abstract = {We propose a methodology to detect the current status of a powered-on drone (flying or at rest), leveraging just the communication traffic exchanged between the drone and its Remote Controller (RC). Our solution, other than being the first of its kind, does not require either any special hardware or to transmit any signal; it is built applying standard classification algorithms to the eavesdropped traffic, analyzing features such as packets inter-arrival time and size. Moreover, it is fully passive and it resorts to cheap and general purpose hardware. To evaluate the effectiveness of our solution, we collected real communication measurements from a drone running the widespread ArduCopter open-source firmware, mounted onboard on a wide range of commercial amateur drones. The results prove that our methodology can efficiently and effectively identify the current state of a powered-on drone, i.e., if it is flying or lying on the ground. In addition, we estimate a lower bound on the time required to identify the status of a drone with the requested level of assurance. The quality and viability of our solution do prove that network traffic analysis can be successfully adopted for drone status identification, and pave the way for future research in the area.},

abstract = {Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control, a promising Vehicular Ad-hoc Network application, automates transportation and improves efficiency. Vehicles form a platoon, following a leader, with their controllers automatically adjusting velocity, based on messages by other vehicles, to keep appropriate distances for safety. Towards deploying secure Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control, several proposals in academia and standardization leave significant questions unanswered. Thwarting adversaries is hard: cryptographic protection ensures access control (authentication and authorization) but falsified kinematic information by faulty insiders (platoon members with credentials, even the platoon leader) can cause platoon instability or vehicle crashes. Filtering out such adversarial data is challenging (computational cost and high false positive rates) but, most important, state-of-the-art misbehavior detection algorithms completely fail during platoon maneuvering. In this paper, we systematically investigate how and to what extent controllers for existing platooning applications are vulnerable, mounting a gamut of attacks, ranging from falsification attacks to jamming and collusion; including two novel attacks during maneuvering. We show how the existing middle-join and leave processes are vulnerable to falsification or 'privilege escalation' attacks. We mitigate such vulnerabilities and enable vehicles joining and exiting from any position (middle-join and middle-exit). We propose a misbehavior detection system that achieves an F1 score of 87% on identifying attacks throughout the lifetime of the platoon formation, including maneuvers. Our cyberphysical simulation framework can be extended to assess any other driving automation functionality in the presence of attackers.},

However, the remit of what UTM systems should incorporate is still in flux, leading to slow progress and lack of clarity in regulations that is already impacting the ability of the UAS industry to evolve. We present the findings of interviews with experts related to UAS, UTM, and general air traffic management in order to understand their concerns and hopes for the future of UTM. In particular, we examine how UTM should be shaped by questions around safety, trustworthiness, and fairness of our airspaces. We use these findings to present a roadmap for future UTM developments, including the introduction of scenario generation to embed these findings in tangible airspace models.},

This paper presents the design and implementation of Privaros's policy-enforcement mechanisms, describes how policies are specified, and shows that policy specification can be integrated with India's Digital Sky portal.

abstract = {Transportation systems of the future can be best modeled as multi-agent systems. A number of coordination protocols such as autonomous intersection management (AIM), adaptive cooperative traffic light control (TLC), cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), among others have been developed with the goal of improving the safety and efficiency of such systems. The overall goal in these systems is to provide behavioral guarantees under the assumption that the participating agents work in concert with a centralized (or distributed) coordinator. While there is work on analyzing such systems from a security perspective, we argue that there is limited work on quantifying trustworthiness of individual agents in a multi-agent system. We propose a framework that uses an epistemic logic to quantify trustworthiness of agents, and embed the use of quantitative trustworthiness values into control and coordination policies. Our modified control policies can help the multi-agent system improve its safety in the presence of untrustworthy agents (and under certain assumptions, including malicious agents). We empirically show the effectiveness of our proposed trust framework by embedding it into AIM, TLC, and CACC platooning algorithms.

abstract = {This article presents a framework to enable the energy-efficient execution of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on edge devices. The framework consists of a pair of edge devices connected via a wireless network: a performance and energy-constrained device D as the first recipient of data and an energy-unconstrained device N as an accelerator for D. Device D decides on-the-fly how to distribute the workload with the objective of minimizing its energy consumption while accounting for the inherent uncertainty in network delay and the overheads involved in data transfer. These challenges are tackled by adopting the data-driven modeling framework of Markov Decision Processes, whereby an optimal policy is consulted by D in O(1) time to make layer-by-layer assignment decisions. As a special case, a linear-time dynamic programming algorithm is also presented for finding optimal layer assignment at once, under the assumption that the network delay is constant throughout the execution of the application. The proposed framework is demonstrated on a platform comprised of a Raspberry PI 3 as D and an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 as N. An average improvement of 31% and 23% in energy consumption is achieved compared to the alternatives of executing the CNNs entirely on D and N. Two state-of-the-art methods were also implemented and compared with the proposed methods.},

The pipelined and iterative machine learning (ML) workflow of this system can operate at low network bandwidths for selective transmission of rare unlabeled events embedded in high-bandwidth real-time sensor data. While radar offers greater range and can overcome the severe signal attenuation experienced by visible light under conditions such as rain or fog, it poses a number of challenges for ML.

abstract = {Incremental and quantitative improvements of two-way interactions with extended realities (XR) are contributing toward a qualitative leap into a state of XR ecosystems being efficient, user-friendly, and widely adopted. However, there are multiple barriers on the way toward the omnipresence of XR; among them are the following: computational and power limitations of portable hardware, social acceptance of novel interaction protocols, and usability and efficiency of interfaces. In this article, we overview and analyse novel natural user interfaces based on sensing electrical bio-signals that can be leveraged to tackle the challenges of XR input interactions. Electroencephalography-based brain-machine interfaces that enable thought-only hands-free interaction, myoelectric input methods that track body gestures employing electromyography, and gaze-tracking electrooculography input interfaces are the examples of electrical bio-signal sensing technologies united under a collective concept of ExG. ExG signal acquisition modalities provide a way to interact with computing systems using natural intuitive actions enriching interactions with XR. This survey will provide a bottom-up overview starting from (i) underlying biological aspects and signal acquisition techniques, (ii) ExG hardware solutions, (iii) ExG-enabled applications, (iv) discussion on social acceptance of such applications and technologies, as well as (v) research challenges, application directions, and open problems; evidencing the benefits that ExG-based Natural User Interfaces inputs can introduce to the area of XR.},

abstract = {Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) protocol is employed in air-ground communication systems to replace legacy radar-based air traffic control systems. However, despite being a recent technology, ADS-B communication does not include security measures. This exposes the communication to potential threats, including message spoofing or fake aircraft generation. To cope with such a security lack, the security community is actively proposing innovative solutions to protect ADS-B communication. However, testing and evaluating security frameworks is complex due to the limited number of simulators and the impossibility of conducting real-world experiments. In this paper, we present an OpenScope-sec an ADS-B simulator to support the security research and the implementation of novel anomaly detection systems. Our simulator extends the existing ADS-B simulator tools with the possibility of implementing a wider range of attacks. The list of attacks included is based on a preliminary analysis of the current literature, where we collected the most common attacks proposed on ADS-B communication and the existing simulators. Finally, for each attack implemented, we discuss possible anomaly detection approaches to detect the attacks and the consequent changes in legitimate parameters. order to detect possible attacks in real ADS-B messages.},

In this paper, we explore version control in the creative domain of live coding music, a generative performance practice where programmers edit and run code live to generate audiovisual artifacts. To that end, we developed SHARP, a lightweight version control system that live coders can use during performances as well as in preparation or practice sessions. We conducted a user study where live coders used SHARP for several weeks, wrote diary entries reflecting on their sessions, recorded a performance using SHARP, and participated in exit interviews. We found that SHARP enabled participants to engage with musical form on the fly in novel ways. In addition, the study revealed multifaceted perspectives on how and when versioning can be useful in the context of live coding. Our results inform the design of versioning systems for live coding and more generally for performance and generative arts practices.},

Whilst head-up displays (HUDs) have proven effective in providing intuitive navigational support on Earth, the design of novel human-spaceflight solutions typically relies on costly and time-consuming analogue deployments, leaving the potential use of lunar HUDs largely under-explored. This paper explores an alternative approach by simulating navigational HUD concepts in a high-fidelity Virtual Reality (VR) representation of the lunar environment. In evaluating these concepts with astronauts and other aerospace experts (n=25), our mixed methods study demonstrates the efficacy of simulated analogues in facilitating rapid design assessments of early-stage HUD solutions. We illustrate this by elaborating key design challenges and guidelines for future lunar HUDs. In reflecting on the limitations of our approach, we propose directions for future design exploration of human-machine interfaces for the Moon.},

Based on our practical experience and lessons learned during development of a SAE level&nbsp;3 automated driving system, we review the different challenges and discuss directions towards solving them. Some of the challenges can be addressed by applying well-known security mechanisms more rigorously. Some must be handled by collaboration across disciplines, such as security and safety, or security and function development. Others were identified as open challenges and we point out where more research is required to develop new solutions and to examine whether a technical solution is possible at all.},

abstract = {Modern autonomous systems rely on both object detection and object tracking in their visual perception pipelines. Although many recent works have attacked the object detection component of autonomous vehicles, these attacks do not work on full pipelines that integrate object tracking to enhance the object detector's accuracy. Meanwhile, existing attacks against object tracking either lack real-world applicability or do not work against a powerful class of object trackers, Siamese trackers. In this paper, we present AttrackZone, a new physically-realizable tracker hijacking attack against Siamese trackers that systematically determines valid regions in an environment that can be used for physical perturbations. AttrackZone exploits the heatmap generation process of Siamese Region Proposal Networks in order to take control of an object's bounding box, resulting in physical consequences including vehicle collisions and masked intrusion of pedestrians into unauthorized areas. Evaluations in both the digital and physical domain show that AttrackZone achieves its attack goals 92% of the time, requiring only 0.3-3 seconds on average.},

abstract = {The Global Positioning System (GPS) has been proved to be exposed to several cybersecurity attacks, due to its intrinsic insecure design. GPS spoofing is one of the most easiest, cheap, and dreadful attacks that can be delivered: fake GPS signals can be sent to a target device and make it moving according to a pre-computed path.Although some proposals exist to discriminate between legitimate and rogue GPS signals, those solutions are still difficult to deploy, since they resort to special hardware capable of identifying physical properties of original GPS signals.In this paper, we propose a brand new approach, exploiting the broadcast signals transmitted by the mobile cellular network infrastructure to validate the position received by the GPS infrastructure. In detail, we provide several contributions: (i) the architecture of our solution; (ii) the analytic models related to the GSM infrastructure, including the number of in-range base stations, the distance to the base stations, and the received signal strength; and, (iii) the results achieved via an extensive measurement campaign, carried out by first collecting GPS signals while driving for more than 158 Km, and then using these data to build an experimental model for the evaluation of the performance of our technique in the detection of a wide number of emulated spoofing attacks.Finally, we also tested our solution against a real GPS spoofing attack. We proved it being able to guarantee 0% false positive and 100% detection with an almost negligible delay---all the system parameters being finely tunable, allowing for a wide range of possible trade-offs.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new paradigm in intelligent surface design for field programming and multi-point focusing. We approach this problem from an entirely different vantage point by leveraging edges and the corresponding Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD), allowing us to avoid the use of highly specialized and expensive element designs. More specifically, we show that a lattice of edge elements (i.e., cheap, thin, rectangular metal plates with length long enough as compared to width) can provide a rich repertoire for programming the RF field. When a wave is incident on an edge, a cone of outgoing rays emerges, known as a Keller cone. When considering a lattice of such edge elements, we then have a rich set of "knobs" for RF field programming, via changing the orientation of the edge elements and exploiting the exiting Keller cones. We then show how to electromagnetically model and design a practical edge element. We further propose an efficient algorithm to configure the orientations of the edges to achieve the desired multi-point focusing. We build sample prototypes of our proposed paradigm, using off-the-shelf material (i.e., 7 cent metal plates). We then show several real-world experiments in three different indoor areas, where an edge lattice focuses the transmitted wave of a WiFi card of a laptop on up to and including 4 focal points (maximum achieved in the literature albeit with much more expensive element designs). Overall, the paper shows the rich potential of edges for RF field programming.},

abstract = {In aviation, safety is paramount, with air traffic control (ATC) playing a crucial role in monitoring aircraft to prevent collisions and manage traffic flows. In response to increasing air traffic, a renewal process has been initiated. This includes deploying the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) communications protocol, which aims to enhance surveillance precision and increase the number of aircraft that can be handled simultaneously. This transition is transforming ATC from a radar-based system to a more advanced satellite-based global positioning system (GPS) location tracking system. However, due to its inherently open design, the ADS-B protocol lacks critical security features such as authentication, necessitating the adoption of additional security measures to mitigate potential cyber-attacks. To address these vulnerabilities, this work introduces Swarm, an innovative distributed ledger-based framework, built on top of the ADS-B protocol and aimed at enhancing the security of air traffic control (ATC) while avoiding single points of failure. Swarm can be integrated into existing ATC infrastructure without requiring any modifications to the ADS-B protocol. We evaluate Swarm through rigorous and realistic attack scenarios, using real-world aviation data, demonstrating its capability to enhance the security of the aviation domain.},
