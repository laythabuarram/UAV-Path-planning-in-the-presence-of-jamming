  abstract={This paper jointly optimizes the flying location and wireless communication transmit power for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) conducting covert operations. This is motivated by application scenarios such as military ground surveillance from airborne platforms, where it is vital for a UAV’s signal transmission to be undetectable by those within the surveillance region. Specifically, we maximize the communication quality to a legitimate receiver, who is also a ground-user but outside the surveillance region, under specific constraints on communication covertness, maximum transmit power, and the UAV’s physical location related to the required surveillance quality. We provide an explicit solution to the optimization problem for one of the most practical constraint combinations. For other constraint combinations, we determine feasible regions for flight, that can then be searched to establish the UAV’s optimal location. In many cases, the 2-dimensional optimal location is achieved by a 1-dimensional search. We discuss two heuristic approaches to UAV placement, and show that in some cases they are able to achieve close to optimal, but that in other cases significant gains can be achieved by employing our developed solutions.},

  abstract={The UAV market has experienced significant growth, with an expanding range of applications. However, the reliance of UAV missions on GNSS makes them vulnerable to attacks, particularly GNSS spoofing and jamming, which can cause mission failure or even physical damage. To mitigate this risk, we propose a lightweight fleet protocol designed to ensure that drones can complete their missions securely, even when under attack. Our system utilizes intra-fleet communication and Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements for positioning, enabling the fleet to maintain formation and reach its destination even under GNSS attacks, or in a GNSS compromised scenario, thus avoiding its vulnerabilities. The proposed protocol was evaluated through extensive simulations using NS-3. The results reveal that the proposed protocol achieves a high mission success rate, reaching 100 % in most single-attack scenarios, and demonstrates robust attack identification even when multiple drones are attacked or compromised. The average attack detection delay was measured at 300 milliseconds for single-attacker scenarios, while the RSSI table was updated every 50 to 55 milliseconds, ensuring data freshness. These findings highlight the potential of our solution to improve the resilience of UAV swarms in GNSS-compromised environments.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of wireless communications, it is challenging to guarantee secure wireless transmission and massive connectivity in the process of data collection. In this paper, we consider an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) communication network. Specifically, the UAV is deployed to collect the data of transmission devices (TDs) in the NOMA manner subject to the eavesdropping attack, while a group of auxiliary devices (ADs) are deployed to provide the cooperative jamming to the eaves-dropper. Driven by this networking model, we aim to maximize the total secrecy capacity by jointly optimizing the TDs’ and ADs’ power allocations and the ADs’ scheduling decisions. Considering the problem’s non-convexity, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based online optimization algorithm to maximize the total secrecy capacity. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve considerable performance gain over some existing algorithms.},

  abstract={The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recently introduced a new standard, namely, remote identification, to improve accountability for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operations. This rule requires UAV operators to broadcast messages revealing sensitive data, such as identity and location on the wireless channel. However, this leads to security and privacy concerns among UAV operators. Unauthorized parties may easily discover the location and identity of a UAV flying in a specific area and launch attacks on it such as using wireless jamming or tracking its activity. This review investigates and systematizes the main weaknesses affecting the Remote ID capability required of modern UAVs, and the approaches through which attackers can exploit these weaknesses to disrupt safety and accountability. Moreover, this article analyzes current solutions that mitigate privacy issues associated with Remote ID. Finally, we identify multiple challenges that require to be addressed by both industry and academia, and we propose future research directions to improve the security and privacy of UAVs.},

  abstract={The expanding use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in vital areas like traffic management, surveillance, and environmental monitoring highlights the need for robust communication and navigation systems. Particularly vulnerable are Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), which face a spectrum of interference and jamming threats that can significantly undermine their performance. While traditional deep learning approaches are adept at mitigating these issues, they often fall short for UAV applications due to significant computational demands and the complexities of managing large, centralized datasets. In response, this paper introduces Federated Reservoir Computing (FedRC) as a potent and efficient solution tailored to enhance interference classification in GNSS systems used by UAVs. Our experimental results demonstrate that FedRC not only achieves faster convergence but also sustains lower loss levels than traditional models, highlighting its exceptional adaptability and operational efficiency.},

  abstract={Due to the lack of perfect regulations and standards in civilian drones field, drones sometimes fly illegally. When illegally flying drones invade airports, which causes flights to be diverted and even airports to be paralyzed. In order to protect the flight safety, drone countermeasure equipment is need to use for driving away illegally flying drones. But drone countermeasure equipment is a new active interference source. When it is used at or around airports, which may cause electromagnetic interference to the surveillance system, and it will not work correctly. Therefore, it is necessary to study protective distances of the surveillance system. In this paper, a method for analyzing the electromagnetic interference influence of drone countermeasure equipment on the surveillance system is proposed. Firstly the radiated field strength of drone countermeasure equipment is measured in an anechoic chamber, and then stray radiation field strengths at frequency bands of a secondary surveillance radar (SSR) and an automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) also are acquired. Meanwhile, test results are compared with protection requirements of electromagnetic environment of SSR and ADS-B. Moreover, electromagnetic interference effects of drone countermeasure equipment on SSR and ADS-B are analyzed according to the electromagnetic compatibility theory and protection ratios of SSR and ADS-B. At last, protective distances of SSR and ADS-B are proposed separately. The results can provide some technical supports for the safe use of drone countermeasure equipment at airports.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely utilized to improve the end-to-end performance of wireless communications. In this paper, we perform a cooperative dual-UAV enabled secure data collection scenario and propose two schemes to ensure the security. The worst-case average secrecy rate is first maximized with the propulsion power limitation, where the scheduling, the transmit power, the trajectory and the velocity of UAVs are jointly optimized. To further save the on-board energy and prolong the flight time, we then maximize the secrecy energy efficiency. Based on the Dinkelbach method, we transform the fractional objective function into an integral expression and propose an iterative algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution. Finally, numerical results are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.},

  abstract={Combining Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (AAVs) with public transportation systems offers a novel approach to enhancing urban last-mile delivery efficiency. However, current research lacks comprehensive solutions for optimizing AAV path planning that can adapt to real-time changes in public transportation schedules while avoiding dynamically changing high-interference zones, ensuring consistent drone connectivity, and accounting for limited drone battery life. This paper addresses these gaps by optimizing and balancing multiple objectives, such as ensuring early arrival, minimizing energy consumption, and reducing signal interference. To achieve these goals, we propose a Q-learning-based algorithm for real-time path optimization, ensuring path adaptability to random changes in interference zones and public transportation schedules, and compare its performance against multi-objective A* algorithm variants. Results show that Q-learning achieves superior early arrival times, energy efficiency, and reduced interference, with a nearly 100% success rate in package deliveries, compared to 60-80% for A*. These findings demonstrate the robustness and reliability of Q-learning in AAV-Aided Public Transportation systems, making it a valuable solution for real-world urban delivery challenges.},

  abstract={Dedicated and aerial fifth generation (5G) networks, here called 5G overlay networks, are envisaged to enhance existing positioning services, when combined with global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and other sensors. There is a need for accurate and timely positioning in safety-critical automotive and aerial applications, such as advanced warning systems or in urban air mobility (UAM). Today, these high-accuracy demands can partially be satisfied by GNSS, though not in dense urban conditions or under GNSS threats (e.g. interference, jamming or spoofing). Temporary and on-demand 5G network deployments using ground and flying base stations (BSs) are indeed a novel solution to exploit hybrid GNSS, 5G and sensor algorithms for the provision of accurate three-dimensional (3D) position and motion information, especially for challenging urban and suburban scenarios. Thus, this paper first analyzes the positioning technologies available, including signals, positioning methods, algorithms and architectures. Then, design considerations of 5G overlay networks are discussed, by including simulation results on the 5G signal bandwidth, antenna array and network deployment.},

  abstract={Aiming at the limitations of traditional clutter suppression algorithms, which cannot achieve radar multipath signal suppression under a single receiving antenna and suffer from high interference when using 5G base stations to detect low-slow-small (LSS) targets, this study proposes a Multipath Clutter Suppression Algorithm Based on Single-Channel Environment Parameter Sensing (MCSEPS) for 5G base stations. The algorithm aims to suppress interfering signals through a single-channel configuration, thereby mitigating the impact of multipath clutter causing false targets when radar detects LSS drones. Algorithm process is as follows: First, set the search range for the received signal delay. Then, establish a signal amplitude estimation model to solve for direct wave signal parameters. After suppressing the direct wave, solve for multipath parameters again based on the set search range, filter out false multipath signals according to a threshold, and finally reconstruct multipath clutter using the recorded multipath parameters to complete the suppression of interfering signals. Experimental simulations show that the proposed method can effectively suppress multipath clutter under a single-channel configuration, with relatively low computational complexity, significantly reducing the impact of multipath clutter on radar target detection.},

  abstract={localization and communications are two fundamental requirements for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) clusters. However, in certain severe environments, the satellite positioning and navigation service is unavailable. Moreover, the information exchange among UAV nodes also faces the risk of eavesdropping and jamming. How to realize relative positioning as well as low probability of interception (LPI) and reliable communications is an urgent issue. Inspired by the above considerations, this paper proposes an integrated communications and positioning protocol with LPI and anti-jamming waveform. We design a flexible frame structure that exploits pilots and the following data symbols for distance measurement and degree of arrival estimation. The data symbols are specially processed via the weighted fractional Fourier 4 transform (WFRFT). Compared to the traditional spread spectrum frequency communication and positioning integration technologies, the WFRFT-based LPI method not only realizes high-precision positioning but also has better security performance. In this way, secure transmission in complex electromagnetic conditions can be achieved and physical layer security can be further improved. Simulation and analysis results show that the low interception communication and positioning integration technology based on an array antenna provides a more secure and accurate solution for wireless communication and positioning, showing considerable potential for development.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used in military and civilian applications, such as surveillance, disaster monitoring, and rescue missions. They rely heavily on global positioning systems (GPS) for navigation. However, the accuracy and availability of GPS positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) data can suffer losses due to jamming and spoofing. To address overreliance on GPS infrastructure, this paper presents a vision-aided system to enable UAVs to estimate velocity and continue operation when GPS signal is intermittently lost. The system fuses data from onboard sensors including the inertial measurement unit (IMU), barometer, and optical flow camera using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The efficiency of this approach was validated through simulation experiments involving a UAV navigating in a circular and square motions. Statistical analysis confirmed the proposed system can provide state estimation and smooth trajectory control for UAVs during GPS signal outages.},

  abstract={In modern-day multi-dimensional recreational drones (UAVs), the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) units in- use are commonly fraught with precise-point-positioning (PPP) data errors or inaccuracies, hence, necessitating this work. These data inaccuracies, occasioned by the system’s drawbacks such as sudden GPS lock or jamming, embedded device misalignment, drone’s limited communication coverage, signaling and detection, all contributes to the system’s PPP computation complexity. To mitigate PPP complexity, an intelligent and robust accurate continuous-discrete (ACD) based hybrid cubature-extended Kalman filter (C-EKF) computation model for an integrated GNSS unit is corroborated in this article. More precisely, time updates to the state and parameter sub-vectors for the GNSS unit is accomplished using the third-degree spherical-radial cubature rule. The system’s testbed simulation is then conducted using tightly-coupled units of (i) ring laser gyroscope (RLG) and (ii) micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) variants of the inertial measurement unit (IMU) to ascertain the PPP cooperative tendencies. Optimized performance comparisons of the proposed hybrid C-EKF over the existing cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and extended Kalman filter (EKF) models with-respect-to (w.r.t) its probabilistic outages, Yaw error-differences and ergodic capacities are demonstrated and presented.},

  abstract={In this paper, the problem of using active unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and a base station (BS) to jointly localize a target UAV under global positioning system (GPS) spoofing attacks is studied. In the considered model, active UAVs transmit signals, which will be reflected by the target UAV and received by active UAVs. Based on the signal transmission time, active UAVs calculate the distance between the target UAV and active UAVs. Then, active UAVs transmit these distance measurement information and their GPS information to the BS for localizing the target UAV. During the localization process, the target UAV is equipped with a GPS jammer, which can interfere with GPS information of active UAVs. Since the localization accuracy depends on distance between the target UAV and active UAVs and GPS information accuracy of active UAVs, active UAVs must optimize their trajectories and determine whether to transmit measurement information to the BS for localizing the target UAV. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the positioning error of the target UAV between the estimated and true positions of the target UAV by jointly optimizing the trajectories of active UAVs and determining distance information transmission scheme. To find the optimal solution, a historical observations and actions-based reinforcement learning (HOA-RL) method is proposed. Compared to traditional state-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods, the proposed method can capture the historical decision-making process of agents and optimally adjust trajectories of active UAVs and measurement information transmission scheme based on their observations. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve 44.4% and 70.4% gains in terms of reducing the positioning error of the target UAV compared to Qmix method and Qtran method, respectively.},

  abstract={This letter proposes a secure edge computing scheme for multi-layer aerial-offshore networks where source unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs) with limited onboard resources offload computation-intensive tasks to either a high-altitude platform or a shore-based station. To safeguard wireless transmissions against multiple surface eavesdroppers with uncertain locations, a mobile jammer UAV (JUAV) dynamically emits artificial noise. The JUAV trajectory, power allocation, and offloading decisions are jointly optimized to minimize the total system latency subject to secrecy rate, mobility, and power constraints. An iterative algorithm combining successive convex approximation and the cross-entropy method is developed to solve the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme reduces latency by 16.6%-28% compared to baselines while incurring only an 11% performance penalty for security protection.},

  abstract={In the modern world, radar systems are being used in various fields. Among those fields are radio monitoring, radio navigation, electronic warfare, organizing of rescue operations during disasters, movement of animals in the wildlife, protection of private territories, etc. In this work we discuss and propose a development and production of a system for radio direction finding within the framework of the protection from civil and special purpose UAVs. As a result of the implementation of this algorithm, it would be possible to obtain information about UAVs with radio emission. By receiving the radio emissions, it would be possible to keep under control those movements. Particularly, if necessary, by additional measurements, it would be possible to implement local radio protection, thus preventing those movements. Note that suggested system would be controlled remotely, which is an advantage in some special cases. This system could be used in other applications where radio detection and direction finding is necessary.},

  abstract={This paper presents a novel framework that combines an optimization-based approach with a deep learning (DL)-based approach to devise a cooperative strategy for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in wireless-based secure communications by leveraging the strengths of both approaches and addressing their respective limitations. We first formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the minimum achievable secrecy rate while guaranteeing the minimum harvested energy requirement for each ground node by optimizing scheduling, transmit power, and trajectory. To address the difficulty of solving the formulated non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, optimization techniques, such as continuous convex approximation and the block coordinate descent algorithm, are used to efficiently find feasible solutions. To tackle the challenges posed by the high computational complexity and initialization sensitivity of the optimization-based approach, we also propose an unsupervised learning-based deep neural network (DNN) structure with a specialized loss function tailored to our goals that allows the DNN to effectively approximate the optimal strategies for UAVs. Finally, we design a pioneering method that integrates the strengths of the two aforementioned approaches, in which the output of the trained DNN serves as the initial values of the optimization variables, and subsequently, optimization techniques are applied to fine-tune these optimization variables, leading to further performance improvements. Through intensive simulations, we confirm that the integrated scheme provides superior performance without constraint violation compared to the DL-based scheme, while guaranteeing faster convergence than the optimization-based scheme.},

Flying robots, often called drones, are starting to play a major role in several tasks such as search and rescue, interaction with the environment, inspection, patrolling and monitoring. Agile and resilient navigation of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) through unknown environments poses a number of challenges in terms of perception, state estimation, planning, and control. To achieve this, MAVs have to localize themselves and coordinate between each other in unstructured environments.

  abstract={Ongoing advances in digitization and automation of critical infrastructures, particularly in terms of aeronautical Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance (CNS) technologies, has led to the fusion of intricate physical and information networks with artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This integration is empowered avionics and Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems with enhanced data processing capabilities, interactive information exchange, and expansive geographic distribution. However, these advancements also expose the systems to increasing cybersecurity threats, physical vulnerabilities, and data integrity risks. The complexity and interconnectedness of CNS infrastructure, combined with ATM systems, amplify the potential scope and depth of attacks and increase their ability to spread through interconnected components. As a result, both ATM and UAS Traffic Management (UTM) systems face an escalation in security challenges. While the concept of cybersecurity within aviation has a long history, its seamless integration into aviation systems remains a significant challenge. Just as AI technology is harnessed to improve the overall operational efficiency and reliability of aviation systems, it has also emerged as a pivotal battleground for cybersecurity risks and threats. Increasingly, AI-driven intrusion and theft methods are replacing traditional approaches. In response, researchers have put forth defensive strategies rooted in AI technology. This paper critically evaluates cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats that may confront ATM and UTM systems. It systematically categorizes a variety of potential threat actors along with their corresponding targets, based on their objectives, motivations, and capabilities. Simultaneously, the paper delves deeply into an exploration of possible attack methodologies founded on AI technology, accompanied by their corresponding defensive tactics.},

  abstract={Redundant navigation systems are critical for safe operation of UAVs in high-risk environments. Since most commercial UAVs almost wholly rely on GPS, jamming, interference, and multi-pathing are real concerns that usually limit their operations to low-risk environments and visual line-of-sight. This letter presents a vision-based route-following system for the autonomous, safe return of UAVs under primary navigation failure such as GPS jamming. Using a Visual Teach and Repeat framework to build a visual map of the environment during an outbound flight, we show the autonomous return of the UAV by visually localizing the live view to this map when a simulated GPS failure occurs, controlling the vehicle to follow the safe outbound path back to the launch point. Using gimbal-stabilized stereo vision and inertial sensing alone, without reliance on external infrastructure, Visual Odometry and localization are achieved at altitudes of 5-25 m and flight speeds up to 55 km/h. We examine the performance of the visual localization algorithm under a variety of conditions and also demonstrate closed-loop autonomy along a complicated 450 m path.},

  abstract={With the development of smart hardware devices and the increasing demand for indoor positioning, Wi-Fi Re-ceived Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)-based fingerprinting has become a simple and low-hardware requirement method for indoor positioning. However, in complex indoor environments, signal attenuation and multipath effects can severely interfere with wireless signal propagation, thereby reducing positioning accuracy. This paper proposes a new positioning scheme that uses an EfficientNetV2 classification model and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) regression model. The scheme first converts RSSI values into feature maps, then uses the EfficientNetV2 model to classify the wall where the drone is located, narrowing down the positioning area. Then the feature maps are input into the proposed CNN model to estimate three-dimensional coordinates and improve positioning accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an average error of 2.01 meters in three-dimensional positioning Euclidean distance, compared to 2.14 meters for the traditional method, resulting in a 6.07 % improvement in positioning accuracy. These results demonstrate the advantages of the new method in overcoming signal interference in indoor environments and effectively improving positioning accuracy.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have revolutionized various industries by providing efficient and automated flight capabilities. However, reliance on GPS and traditional navigation systems poses challenges in scenarios where signal interference or failures occur. In this research, we present a novel computer-vision-based method to enhance UAV navigation, enabling accurate height and location estimation. Our approach utilizes a sophisticated network that leverages a pair of images to estimate UAV height. The pyramid stereo-matching network is employed to extract robust image features and generate a disparity map. Subsequently, a custom network processes and convolves these data, employing diverse computer vision techniques to achieve precise height estimation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we collected a comprehensive dataset by conducting flights with a Phantom 4 Pro drone over the NUST Main campus, H-12 Islamabad. The dataset encompasses images captured at 10 different heights, spanning from 100 to 280 m, with flights evenly spaced 20 m apart. In rigorous evaluations, our approach demonstrates promising results compared to existing methods. By liberating UAVs from reliance on GPS, this vision-based 3-D localization technique holds immense potential to ensure successful flights even in challenging environments.},

  abstract={The multi-satellite multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system with full frequency reuse (FFR) has high spectral efficiency. However, satellite communications are highly susceptible to interference, and the communication quality of multi-satellite MIMO communication systems with FFR will be seriously affected when suffering from close-range interference from mobile unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Cluster. Therefore, we utilize an online blind source separation (BSS) algorithm without the aid of a priori information for the anti-jamming of mobile UAV clusters, which can avoid the additional occupation of channel resources, as well as process the mixed signals of time-varying systems and output separated signals in real-time. In this paper, the R-V-M-EASI algorithm is proposed, which adjusts the adaptive step size and momentum term factor using the crosstalk index as a separation performance index. The mutation point of the time-varying mixing matrix can be determined by detecting the change of the error function and then using a better converged separation matrix before the mutation to separate the observation signal retrospectively. Simulation results show that the R-V-M-EASI algorithm can effectively separate the mixed signals in both stationary and non-stationary environments, and it has faster convergence speed and lower steady error. For scenarios where the mixed matrix mutates, the proposed algorithm is effective in improving the separation accuracy of the separation matrix at the initial stage.},

  abstract={UAVs are increasingly appearing in swarms or formations to leverage cooperative behavior, forming flying ad hoc networks. These UAV-enabled networks can meet several complex mission requirements and are seen as a potential enabler for many of the emerging use-cases in future communication networks. Such networks, however, are characterized by a highly dynamic and mobile environment with no guarantee of a central network infrastructure which can cause both connectivity and security issues. While wireless mesh networks are envisioned as a solution for such scenarios, these networks come with their own challenges and security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we analyze the key security and resilience issues resulting from the application of wireless mesh networks within UAV swarms. Specifically, we highlight the main challenges of applying current mesh technologies within the domain of UAV swarms and expose existing vulnerabilities across the communication stack. Based on this analysis, we present a security-focused architecture for UAV mesh communications. Finally, from the identification of these vulnerabilities, we discuss research opportunities posed by the unique challenges of UAV swarm connectivity.},

  abstract={The problem of cooperative arraying to jam is an important part of EW mission planning. Aiming at the problem that multi-objective optimization algorithm is easy to fall into local optimum and converge in three-objective optimization, a multi-aircraft jamming and cooperative arraying method based on improved multi-objective Moth-flame optimization algorithm is proposed. Firstly, the simulation environment is established by using digital elevation map and radar detection model. Then, based on the multi-objective Moth-flame optimization algorithm, the population initialization is completed by using Logistic-Tent chaotic map, which increases the diversity and uniformity of the solution and improves the search ability of the algorithm; Then, the decision factor and Gaussian difference mutation are introduced, which makes the algorithm not only accept the current solution with a certain probability, but also jump out of the current solution and search again according to the disturbance, thus enhancing the search ability of the algorithm; Finally, by comparing with NSGA-II, MOEA/D, MOPSO and NSMFO algorithms on test functions of ZDT and DTLZ series, the performance of the algorithm is verified, and it is proved that multi-objective Moth-flame optimization algorithm is better than other algorithms in both convergence and diversity. In addition, compared with the NSMFO and MOEA/D algorithms in the arraying simulation experiment. The values of the interference power, the width of the route safety zone and the detection area of the radar obtained by the algorithm in this paper, are 117.9 kw, 46 km, and 1727 km2. Compared with the results of the other two algorithms, the effectiveness of interference is improved by 39.8%, 22.8% and 41.9% respectively.},

  abstract={Due to the high flexibility and mobility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be deployed as aerial relays touring to serve ground users (GUs), especially when the ground base station is temporally damaged. However, the broadcasting nature of wireless channels makes such communication vulnerable to be wiretapped by malicious eavesdropping users (EUs). Besides the collecting offloading data for legitimate GUs, UAVs are also expected to be friendly jammers, i.e., generating artificial noise (AN) to deteriorate the wiretapping of EUs. With this in mind, a novel role switching scheme (RSS) is proposed in the paper to guarantee the secure communication by the cooperation of multiple UAVs, where each UAV is allowed to switch its role as a collector or a jammer autonomously to explore a wider trajectory space. It’s worthy to be noticed that the joint optimization for the trajectory of UAVs and the transmission power of GUs and UAVs with role switching scheme is a non-convex mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. Since the relaxation of binary variables will lead the solution dropping into local minimum, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined successive convex approximate (SCA) algorithm is further designed to maximize the achievable secrecy rate (ASR) of GUs. Numerical results illustrate that compared with the role fixed scheme (RFS) and relaxation based SCA approaches, the proposed DRL-SCA algorithm endows UAVs the capacity to fly close enough to target users (both GUs and EUs) with less moving distance which brings better ASR and less energy consumption.},

  abstract={With the wide application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the increasing complexity of battlefield electromagnetic environment, it is of great significance to predict the anti-interference performance of UAV data link under dynamic mission scenarios. However, a practical data link performance prediction model of UAV under interference environment, which can assist in practical flight route planning, has not been established. In this paper, Sequential Number Theory Optimization(SNTO) improved Support Vector Machine(SVM) is proposed to construct a classification prediction model of UAV communication quality, which can be used to optimize the flight route when a jammer is operating. By comparison, modeling efficiency of SNTO improved SVM is higher than that of grid search improved SVM and particle swarm optimization(PSO) improved SVM. Through prediction ability validation at test set, the prediction accuracy of the model obtained from SNTO improved SVM exceeds $96 \%$, which can provide auxiliary decision-making for commanders in mission planning stage, and thus reduce the probability of lost control and crash of UAV in battlefield.},

  abstract={The autonomous operation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relies on reliable self-localization, which is typically achieved using global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). However, GNSS data can be unreliable due to effects of space weather phenomena or interference from GNSS jamming. To ensure accurate localization in such conditions, vision-based approaches for UAV positioning offer a potential alternative, though they often come with trade-offs in positioning accuracy or computational efficiency. In this paper, we present a real-time method for vision-based UAV self-localization that achieves GNSS-like accuracy. This approach involves extracting high-level semantic features from captured images and matching them to geo-referenced OpenStreetMap (OSM) data of the flight area. The global location of the UAV is then determined based on the matching results. We also compare and evaluate different metrics for measuring scene similarity to enhance the system's performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that even when OSM data is partially inaccurate, it can still be used to achieve accurate localization. This holds true even with a non-optimal neural network for segmentation and in environments with limited semantic features. The dataset used for evaluation will be made available with publication of this paper.},

  abstract={Over the past decade, unmanned airborne vehicles (UAVs; widely known as drones) are quickly being deployed in various civilian as well as military applications. Drones can self-organize into a connected swarm (Flying Ad Hoc Networks– FANETs) to complete various challenging missions. As the primary building block of Internet-of-Drones (IoD), FANETs have an important role to play in governing the autonomous movement of drones and supporting drone-to-everything (D2X) communications. However, factors such as flying characteristics and the highly dynamic topology of FANETs compound the challenges of packet forwarding; thus, the focus of this article. Specifically, a stochastic packet forwarding algorithm (hereafter referred to as SPA) is proposed for FANETs, where the data packets can be efficiently transferred to the destination. In SPA, the packet sender evaluates each next hop forwarding candidate drone based on different network metrics, prior to selecting the next hop forwarding drone according to the forwarding probability. In addition, an analytical model is developed to evaluate the performance of SPA. Then, the link expiration time and link throughput are chosen as network metrics for network simulation experiments, where SPA is evaluated and compared with prior schemes (e.g,  $DTN_{geo}$  and GeoUAVs). The performance of SPA is evaluated in a real-world testbed to complement the network simulation experiments. Findings from the evaluations demonstrate that SPA obtains better performance in terms of packet delivery ratio, packet delivery latency, the number of delivered data packets, average link lifetime, and bit error rate.},

  pages={55233-55280},
  abstract={Flying Ad-Hoc Networks (FANETs) are groups of UAVs connected in an Ad-Hoc manner to accomplish a common mission. The widespread acceptance of UAVs due to their low cost and high efficiency has attracted malicious security attacks against them. These attacks cannot be easily prevented due to UAVs’ limited computational power, short battery life, and inability to execute complex algorithms. FANETs rely on the Global Positioning System (GPS) for localization. GPS Spoofing, an easy-to-launch attack, is one of the main challenges in FANETs. In which, the legitimate and not-encrypted civilian GPS signals are overridden by counterfeit signals to deceive the UAVs to collide or to be hijacked. Researchers proposed various countermeasures to address GPS Spoofing attacks in FANETs. To further assist future research, this paper provides a systematic literature review on GPS Spoofing attacks in FANETs and their defense mechanisms. After formulating eight research questions and applying well-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria and quality assessment tools, 70 research articles were extracted. The existing defense mechanisms were classified based on their objectives (i.e., detection, mitigation, and/or prevention) and according to their basis (i.e., relying on readings from various drones’ devices/sensors, processing the signals received by various sensors, employing machine learning algorithms, relying on game theory, or leveraging cryptographic techniques to authenticate and protect the confidentiality of GPS signals). The defense mechanisms were also analyzed to identify the attacker models, impacts of the attack, and detection performance. This study found that most of the proposed methods are detection approaches, rather than mitigation or prevention. Also, almost all papers used simulation experiments rather than a proof-of-concept implementation, which does not demonstrate a convincing performance under realistic mobility and propagation models. Moreover, most solutions addressed GPS Spoofing for a single UAV. Only eight articles addressed multiple UAV scenarios and none of them provided a proof-of-concept evaluation.},

  abstract={To address the critical issue of public safety threats caused by disordered low-altitude UAV operations, this paper proposes DG-MFCO (Dual-stage Greedy-Driven & Multi-step Foresight Collaborative Optimization), a deceptive source deployment optimization scheme. The algorithm aims to achieve maximum interference coverage with minimal deceptive sources, thereby effectively intercepting unauthorized UAVs. The methodology initiates with a three-dimensional airspace modeling process: the target area undergoes grid discretization followed by vertical stratified sampling to generate elevation-embedded spatial point clouds. We establish a terrain-aware interference station deployment model by integrating ray tracing principles and viewshed analysis, complemented by defining a comprehensive 3D interference coverage evaluation criterion. Note to Practitioners—The solution adopts a dual-stage optimization strategy. In the preliminary phase, a parallelized greedy algorithm rapidly identifies optimal positions with maximal coverage contribution. The advanced phase implements a multi-step neighborhood foresight mechanism, employing a distance-decay weighted function to assess potential values of uncovered regions, ultimately selecting positions with maximum potential as optimal deceptive source locations. The final results indicate that under complex mountainous terrain conditions, compared to the greedy algorithm and the particle swarm optimization algorithm, the DG-MFCO algorithm achieves a stable 90% full airspace coverage ratio by deploying only eight deceptive sources, while demonstrating strong robustness and repeatability. This proves the engineering practicality of the proposed method in complex topographic conditions.},

  pages={2890-2900},
  abstract={Optical wireless communication (OWC) stands out as a potential enabling technology poised to drive the rapid deployment of sixth-generation (6G)-based indoor wireless networks. However, one of the major limitations of utilizing laser-based OWC technology in indoor environments is the non-availability of line-of-sight (LoS) connectivity between the communicating devices due to blockages. To tackle the problem of LoS non-availability, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and optical intelligent reflecting surfaces (OIRS) are exhibited as potential solutions. This article proposes the integration of laser-based OWC technology with an OIRS-assisted UAV to support the quality of service (QoS) requirements for 6G-based indoor wireless networks. Specifically, we develop a joint user selection and mirror element assignment problem to maximize the number of users served subject to QoS and OWC-related design constraints. This joint optimization problem was an NP-hard binary non-linear problem, which can be optimally solved in polynomial time using sequential-fixing linear programming. To realize our optimization in a distributed manner, we propose a batch-based user-selection and mirror-element assignment (BMEA) scheme that performs simultaneous mirror-element assignment decisions for several contending users. The obtained results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing reference schemes in terms of spectrum efficiency, sum rate, number of served users, and fairness.},

  year={2025},
  volume={},

  pages={01-11},
  abstract={This paper proposes a dynamic airspace corridor planning method based on a complex urban digital twin model. The method fully considers multiple environmental factors such as urban microclimate variations, signal interference, temporary no-fly zones and building density. It can generate highly accurate gridded airspace information in real time, enabling safe and efficient airspace corridor planning for large-scale, high-density and dynamically changing multi-UAV cooperative operations. This study adopts a divide-and-conquer approach that combines fluid models, the A* path planning algorithm, and Laplace equation solving to construct adaptive, obstacle-avoiding, high-density airspace corridors within hierarchical subregions. Through refined airspace zoning control and dynamic optimization, the system strictly enforces safety intervals throughout the planning process, ensuring the minimum safety distance between corridors and minimising the potential collision risks between UAVs. The proposed dynamic airspace corridor planning method has been evaluated in a randomly generated environment and an urban digital twin model. Experimental results show that even in complex urban environments with dense high-rise buildings and drastic wind speed variations, the method can still quickly construct a feasible airspace corridor network. In addition, using a graph-theory based local optimisation algorithm, the method can achieve dynamic, seamless interconnection of multi-segment airspace corridors and flexibly adjust deployment strategies for redundant corridors. In the event of emergencies or drastic environmental changes, these redundant corridors can serve as emergency bypass routes, ensuring that UAVs can avoid obstacles and safely maintain continuous flight,},

  abstract={Small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAV) or 'drones' are projected to rapidly develop in the future and be employed for a multitude of applications such as parcel delivery, search and rescue, surveillance monitoring, and farming. Consequently, an increase in sUAV traffic may lead to a higher likelihood of failure, and crash occur primarily due to environmental factors. Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate the influence of environmental factors on sUAV operations.The study identifies three environmental risk categories relevant to Singapore’s context, namely weather, obstacle, and signal. Subsequently, Python code was developed to perform data analysis on environmental risk data gathered from open source, relevant agencies, and literature surveys. Three environmental risk factors were considered for proof of concept, namely rainfall, windspeed, bird population, and cell tower signal strength.From the data analysis, the average daily rainfall across weather stations in Singapore was observed to be 8.58 mm. In August, weather stations in West of Singapore, such as Choa Chu Kang and Tengah, reported the highest rainfall, approximately 22.65 mm. In contrast, weather stations in the East such as Changi and Pasir Ris reported the lowest rainfall near 0.036 mm in February. Data of the three most invasive bird species in Singapore was examined. The site of Chinese Garden in West Singapore reported the highest bird population of 432 birds per site. The study of bird population data potentially provides an insight into the possibility of sUAV bird strike events. Similarly, signal strength data from cell towers in Singapore was studied.Overall environmental risk-tiering can be visualized using all the analyzed environmental factors data on a risk map. The regions with high rainfall, increased bird population per site and strong signal interference can be extracted.These high-risk locations can be expected to be more hazardous for sUAVs to fly in. Findings for environmental risk-tiering and risk-mapping are preliminary and based on the available environmental data as identified in this study. Further research will be done to include other environmental risk factors and to generate better accuracy of the environmental risk-tier map. Insights from this study will facilitate the demarcation of low, medium, and high-risk areas for risk assessment of sUAVs operation in Singapore.},

  abstract={Autonomy plays a key role for efficient operations in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concepts, making precise localization of the aircraft crucial, especially during take-off and landing. Vertiports, designated landing sites for eVTOLs, can provide the means of ground-based precise positioning, such as augmented GNSS-based, vision-based or radar-based positioning. Among these, radar offers robustness against adverse weather and jamming. This paper proposes a loosely-coupled fusion architecture for both radar-based and GNSS-based 3D positioning with commonly used UAV sensors. The proposed architecture is based on Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF), which simplifies kinematic equations by incorporating a three-dimensional attitude error in the state vector while still maintaining a singularity- and gimbal-lock-free attitude representation with quaternions to describe the absolute attitude. Measurement covariances for radar and GNSS positions are calculated with the geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) values, which represent the geometric relationship between the error in distance measurements and the positioning error. Flight tests with an octocopter compare INS/GNSS, INS/Radar and INS/GNSS/Radar fusion schemes. Results demonstrate that incorporating radar alongside GNSS significantly improves positioning accuracy, while maintaining flexibility through a loosely-coupled fusion architecture.},

  abstract={Localization of radio frequency (RF) sources has critical applications, including search and rescue, jammer detection, and monitoring of hostile activities. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer significant advantages for RF source localization (RFSL) over terrestrial methods, leveraging autonomous 3D navigation and capturing stronger signals at higher altitudes. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have further enhanced localization accuracy, particularly for outdoor scenarios. DL models often face challenges in real-world deployment due to training on simulated datasets that do not fully replicate real-world conditions. To address this, we first propose the Enhanced Two-Ray propagation model, reducing the simulation-to-reality gap by improving the accuracy of propagation environment modeling. For RFSL, we propose the 3D Cluster-Based RealAdap-tRNet, a DL-based method that leverages 3D clustering-based feature extraction for robust localization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Enhanced Two-Ray model provides superior accuracy in simulating real-world propagation scenarios. Notably, the 3D Cluster-Based RealAdaptRNet, trained entirely on simulated data, achieves exceptional performance when validated in a real-world setting using the AERPAW physical testbed, with an average localization error of 18.2 m. The proposed approach is computationally efficient—using 33.5× fewer parameters—and generalizes well across diverse trajectories, making it highly suitable for real-world applications.},

  abstract={A decentralized swarm approach for the fast cooperative flight of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in feature-poor environments without any external localization and communication is introduced in this letter. A novel model of a UAV neighborhood is proposed to achieve robust onboard mutual perception and flocking state feedback control, which is designed to decrease the inter-agent oscillations common in standard reactive swarm models employed in fast collective motion. The novel swarming methodology is supplemented with an enhanced Multi-Robot State Estimation (MRSE) strategy to increase the reliability of the purely onboard localization, which may be unreliable in real environments. Although MRSE and the neighborhood model may rely on information exchange between agents, we introduce a communication-less version of the swarming framework based on estimating communicated states to decrease dependence on the often unreliable communication networks of large swarms. The proposed solution has been verified by a set of complex real-world experiments to demonstrate its overall capability in different conditions, including a UAV interception-motivated task with a group velocity reaching the physical limits of the individual hardware platforms.},

  abstract={UAVs have garnered considerable attention due to their stealth, survivability, and the elimination of human casualties. Beyond traditional reconnaissance and attack, they have expanded into early warning, command, and electronic warfare. Particularly, small UAVs, equipped with lightweight precision instruments, transitions from standalone operations to sophisticated manned-unmanned teaming and swarm network configurations, further broadening their application horizons. However, the escalating costs associated with these advancements underscore the importance of efficient and reliable recovery methods. Recognizing the challenges posed by reduced navigation accuracy during UAVs’ recovery, especially within complex environments for swarms, we introduce an innovative radio positioning method, which harnesses signal transmissions among nodes to achieve relative positioning, thereby facilitating safe recovery. Addressing conventional positioning techniques often struggle to meet requirements at low ranging accuracies, we delved into the realm of cooperative positioning and proposed a novel TDOA-Chan method. Through theoretical derivation and simulations, we demonstrate that cooperative positioning among nodes can markedly enhance positioning accuracy, even under conditions of limited TDOA ranging precision. Our work not only shows the potential of cooperative positioning, but also paves the way for future endeavors aimed at optimizing UAV control.},

  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-10},
  abstract={A reliable command and control (C2) data link is required for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) operations in order to monitor the status and support the control of UAS. A practical realization of the C2 communication and mission data links for commercial UAS operations is via LTE/5G networks. While the trajectory of each UAS directly determines the flight distance and mission cost in terms of energy dissipation, it also has a strong correlation to the quality of the communication link provided by a serving base station, where quality is defined as the achieved signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) required to maintain the control link of the UAS. Due to signal interference and the use of RF spectrum resources, the trajectory of a UAS not only determines the communication link quality it will encounter, but also influences the link quality of other UAS in its vicinity. Therefore, effective UAS traffic management must plan the trajectory for a group of UAS taking into account the impact to the interference levels of other base stations and UAS communication links. In this paper, an SINR Aware Predictive Planning (SAPP) framework is presented for trajectory planning of UAS leveraging 4G/5G communication networks in a simulated environment. The goal is to minimize flight distance while ensuring a minimum required link quality for C2 communications between UAS and base stations. The predictive control approach is proposed to address the challenges of the time varying SINR caused by the interference from other UAS’s communication. Experimental results show that the SAPP framework provides more than 3dB improvements on average for UAS communication parameters compared to traditional trajectory planning algorithms while still achieving shortest path trajectories and collision avoidance.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned to be extensively employed for assisting wireless communications in the Internet of Things (IoT). On the other hand, terahertz (THz)-enabled intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is expected to be one of the core enabling technologies for forthcoming beyond-5G (B5G) wireless communications that promise a broad range of data-demand applications. In this article, we propose a UAV-mounted IRS (UIRS) communication system over THz bands for confidential data dissemination from an access point (AP) toward multiple ground user equipments (UEs) in IoT networks. Specifically, the AP intends to send data to the scheduled UE, while unscheduled UEs may behave as potential adversaries. To protect information messages from the privacy preservation perspective, we aim to devise an energy-efficient multi-UAV covert communication scheme, where the UIRS is for reliable data transmissions, and an extra UAV is utilized as an aerial cooperative jammer, opportunistically generating artificial noise (AN) to degrade unscheduled UEs detection, leading to communication covertness improvement. This poses a novel max-min optimization problem in terms of minimum average energy efficiency (mAEE), aiming to improve covert throughput and reduce UAVs’ propulsion energy consumption, subject to satisfying some practical constraints such as the covertness requirements for which we obtain analytical expressions. Since the optimization problem is nonconvex, we tackle it via the block successive convex approximation (BSCA) approach to iteratively solve a sequence of approximated convex subproblems, designing the binary user scheduling, AP’s power allocation, maximum AN jamming power, IRS beamforming, and both UAVs’ trajectory and velocity planning. Finally, we present a low-complex overall algorithm for system performance enhancement with complexity and convergence analysis. Numerical results are provided to verify the analysis and demonstrate significant outperformance of our design over other existing benchmark schemes concerning the mAEE performance.},

  abstract={To satisfy the explosive access demands of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, various kinds of multiple access techniques have received much attention. In this article, we investigate the multicast communication of a satellite and aerial-integrated network (SAIN) with rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), where both satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) components are controlled by network management center and operate in the same frequency band. Considering a content delivery scenario, the UAV subnetwork adopts the RSMA to support massive access of IoT devices (IoTDs) and achieve desired performances of interference suppression, spectral efficiency, and hardware complexity. We first formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum rate of the considered system subject to the signal-interference-plus-noise-ratio requirements of IoTDs and per-antenna power constraints at the UAV and satellite. To solve this nonconvex optimization problem, we exploit the sequential convex approximation and the first-order Taylor expansion to convert the original optimization problem into a solvable one with the rank-one constraint, and then propose an iterative penalty function-based algorithm to solve it. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed method can effectively suppress the mutual interference and improve the system sum rate compared to the benchmark schemes.},

  abstract={Current collision avoidance techniques deployed on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) rely on short-range sensors, such as proximity sensors, cameras, and microphones. Unfortunately, their efficiency is significantly limited in several situations; for instance, when a remote UAV approaches at high velocity, or when the surrounding environment is impaired (e.g., fog, noise). In the cited cases, to avoid collisions and maintain self-separation, UAVs often rely on the indiscriminate broadcast of their location. Therefore, an adversary could easily identify the location of the UAV and attack it, e.g., by physically shutting it down, launching wireless jamming attacks, or continuing tracking its movements. To address the above-introduced threats, in this article we present PPCA, a lightweight, distributed, and privacy-preserving scheme to avoid collisions among UAVs. Our solution, based on an ingenious tessellation of the space, is accompanied by a thorough analytical model and is supported by an extensive experimental campaign performed on a real 3DR-Solo drone. The achieved results are striking: PPCA can efficiently and effectively avoid collisions among UAVs, by requiring a limited bandwidth and computational overhead (84.85% less than traditional privacy-preserving proximity testing approaches), while providing unique benefits in terms of privacy of the participating UAVs.},

  abstract={This work presents a pipeline for autonomous emergency landing for multicopters, such as rotary wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), using deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). Mechanical malfunctions, strong winds, sudden battery life drops (e.g, due to cold weather), failure in localization or GPS jamming are not uncommon and all constitute emergency situations that require a UAV to abort its mission early and land as quickly as possible in the immediate vicinity. To this end, it is crucial for a UAV that is deployed in real missions to be able to detect a safe landing spot efficiently and proceed to land autonomously, avoiding damage to both its integrity and the surroundings. Driven by the advances in semantic segmentation and depth completion using machine learning, the proposed architecture uses deep RL to infer actions from semantic and depth information, flying the robot towards secure areas, while respecting safety constraints. Thanks to our robust training strategy and the choice of these mid-level representations as input to the RL agent, we show that our policy can directly transfer to the real world, without the need for any additional fine-tuning. In a series of challenging experiments both in simulation and with a real platform, we demonstrate that our planner guides a rotorcraft UAV to a safe landing spot up to 1.5 times faster and with double success rate than the state of the art (including a commercially available solution), paving the way towards realistically deployable UAVs.},

  abstract={This paper furthers the state of the art of visual localization by harnessing recently developed scene recognition and understanding machine learning (ML) algorithms to rethink how vision can be used for navigation, particularly when combined with a realistic, minimalist, and robust multi-agent approach. The focus on visual navigation comes as GPS is increasingly unreliable (jammed, spoofed, or disabled), or unavailable (indoor, or extraterrestrial environments). GPS denial/unreliability is an area of active research in general, with unmanned parafoil systems being one UAV application. The landing locations for parafoil systems must be pre-programmed manually with global coordinates, which may be inaccurate or outdated, and offer no in-flight adaptability. This paper will introduce a novel and minimalist approach to visual navigation and multi-agent communication using semantic machine learning classification and geometric constraints. This approach enables localization and landing site identification for multiple communicating UAV systems deployed in GPS-denied environments. This is a capability extending beyond singleagent localization, as well as a novel landing site classification approach. A mathematical foundation using information theory provides the technical grounding for the algorithms presented, and simulation results demonstrate how multiple agents using the proposed algorithms make a significant improvement in localization accuracy and speed over a single agent. Desirable landing sites for UAVs generally, and autonomous parafoils in particular, constitute locations where payload survivability and accessibility are greatest. An on-board semantic representation and understanding of the operating environment will allow systems to automatically detect and classify these desirable and undesirable landing sites, enabling successful landing in a much larger class of scenarios than currently possible, in addition to a fail-safe capability when localization is not feasible. This paper will further introduce an algorithm enabling multiple agents to reproduce this classification of their environment on-line better and more rapidly than a single agent working alone, demonstrating the advantage of multiple agents in this context as well. This has applications to general UAV landing, whether powered or unpowered, on Earth or in extra-terrestrial environments.},
