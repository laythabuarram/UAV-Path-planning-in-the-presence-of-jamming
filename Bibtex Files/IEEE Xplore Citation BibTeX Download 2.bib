  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been increasingly used in a wide range of commercial and civilian applications. As an advanced cyber-physical system, UAVs are exposed to a wide range of cyberattacks. This paper first surveys existing literature for different cyberattacks. Then, we classify these attacks based on their attack entry points, which can be radio channels, messages or on-board systems. There are six classes of UAV cyberattacks, namely channel jamming, message interception, message deletion, message injection, message spoofing and on-board system attack. In the existing literature, there is no survey focusing on UAV cyberattack countermeasures. To close this gap, we survey existing countermeasures for the six attack classes. A comprehensive review of countermeasures is important because countermeasure may not be exclusive to an attack. Knowing a wide range of existing countermeasures can prepare us against existing and new cyberattacks. We classify countermeasure into three classes, namely prevention, detection and mitigation. Prevention countermeasures stop a cyberattack from starting. When prevention countermeasures fail, detection countermeasures alert UAV operator of an attack. After detecting an attack, mitigation countermeasures limits the damage. Following the survey, we further discuss the open challenges in developing countermeasures and propose some potential future research works.},

  abstract={Phased array radio systems (PARS) on the ground can determine the direction and range to uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV) that it communicates with. By communicating the position back to the UAV, it can be used for navigation also in conditions when GNSS or other positioning systems are unavailable. In this paper we report field tests with fixed-wing UAV flights under actual GNSS jamming, where an inertial navigation system (INS) aided by both GNSS and PARS is tested. The experimental results show that uninterrupted stable flight is possible by switching between GNSS and PARS aiding. The results also show that reliable integrity monitoring of the GNSS and PARS are essential for resilient navigation when switching between GNSS and PARS, especially in conditions when the UAV fly outside the PARS frustum while GNSS is jammed.},

  abstract={This paper presents an experimental analysis of the impact of various jamming signal types on the performance of modern global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers, including those for the Global Positioning System (GPS) and GLONASS. The ability to effectively disrupt GNSS signals is of growing importance in both military and civilian domains. In military scenarios, GNSS jamming supports navigation warfare (NAVWAR) operations by degrading the adversary's positioning and timing capabilities, while also enabling protection against unauthorized unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) activity. In civilian contexts, understanding jamming mechanisms is essential for developing robust mitigation techniques and securing critical infrastructure, such as air traffic control, maritime navigation, and telecommunications. The paper compares the effectiveness of several jamming waveforms, including continuous wave, binary phase shift keying (BPSK), additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), and intermittent five-carrier signals, based on measured jamming-to-signal ratios (JSRs). A novel energy-efficient jamming method is proposed, demonstrating effective GNSS disruption with reduced power requirements, making it suitable for integration into UAV-based electronic warfare systems.},

  abstract={This paper proposes an anti-jamming transmission algorithm based on game theory and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) for the integrated air-ground network. For uplink process, we propose UAV deployment schemes based on congestion game model and dynamic networking schemes based on coalition game, aiming to counteract malicious jamming from ground and air jammers, effectively enhancing the anti-jamming transmission capability of air-ground networks. For downlink process, to address the joint trajectory and power optimization problem, a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework is utilized, follows a centralized training and distributed execution framework. During the centralized training process, experiences of each agent interacting with the environment are stored in an experience replay pool and then used to train the soft actor-critic network. This process is conducted on the high altitude platforms (HAP) to alleviate the burden of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). During the distributed execution process, each UAV uses the trained actor network to output actions based on observations and adjust its flight position and transmission power for joint service provision. To update the parameters of the soft actor-critic network, an improved proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional algorithms in terms of achieving higher system achievable sum rate, lower power consumption, and faster convergence speed.},

  abstract={Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) such as GPS are the de-facto standard for absolute and reliable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) localization due to their global availability and the maturity and wide spread of the underlying technology. However, as the spread and reliance upon autonomous UAV systems increases, the risk of jamming becomes a substantial safety problem. The area where jamming attacks are most likely to occur is the close vicinity of the UAV landing station. Hence, to ensure reliable operations, an alternative localization technology for the approach and landing phase is needed. This paper presents a localization system for 3D position estimation based on 24 GHz FMCW cooperative radar. It has very low infrastructure requirements thanks to the combination of ranging and direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation techniques employed in the ground station. Jamming resistance is improved due to the large bandwidth of 250 MHz. A measurement campaign was conducted to prove the feasibility of the proposed concept.},

  abstract={Thanks to excellent mobility and high probability of a Line-of-Sight (LoS) to ground objects, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in surveillance. This paper considers the use of UAVs to covertly and collaboratively eavesdrop on suspicious wireless transmitters on the ground. We focus on the trajectory planning of the UAVs. To avoid the UAVs being visually noticed by the ground transmitters, we propose a new measure to quantify the disguising performance of the UAVs. The trajectories of the UAVs are planned to maximize the disguising performance, subject to an uninterrupted eavesdropping requirement, UAV collision avoidance and UAV aeronautic maneuverability. A new randomized method based on the Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) is developed to efficiently construct the trajectories of the UAVs. Computer simulations confirm that the proposed method outperforms the random movement method in eavesdropping performance, while achieving with comparable disguising performance.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose a covert air-ground transmission scheme for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), where the sensing signal can be utilized as a mask to disrupt the detection of communication by Willie. To further enhance the covertness, a full-duplex (FD) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) user is deployed to receive the covert signal while transmitting the artificial jamming to confuse Willie. The minimum detection error probability (MDEP) is first calculated by deriving the optimal detection threshold, and the analytic expression of average MDEP is obtained. Then, the covert transmission rate is maximized while satisfying the target detection constraint, the covertness constraint as well as the transmit power constraint, which can be resolved by an alternating optimization algorithm. Finally, simulation results are presented to demonstrate that the proposed scheme with the FD jamming can better guarantee the covertness of air-ground ISAC.},

  abstract={Thanks to their quick placement and high flexibility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be very useful in the current and future wireless communication systems. With a growing number of smart devices and infrastructure-free communication networks, it is necessary to legitimately monitor these networks to prevent crimes. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to exploit the flexibility of the UAV for legitimate monitoring via joint trajectory design and energy management. The system includes a suspicious transmission link with a terrestrial transmitter and a terrestrial receiver, and a UAV to monitor the suspicious link. The UAV can adjust its positions and send jamming signal to the suspicious receiver to ensure successful eavesdropping. Based on this model, we first develop an approach to minimize the overall jamming energy consumption of the UAV. Building on a judicious (re-)formulation, an alternating optimization approach is developed to compute a locally optimal solution in polynomial time. Furthermore, we model and include the propulsion power to minimize the overall energy consumption of the UAV. Leveraging the successive convex approximation method, an effective iterative approach is developed to find a feasible solution fulfilling the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Extensive numerical results are provided to verify the merits of the proposed schemes.},

  abstract={In this paper, we focus on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted covert communication scenario, and introduce an optimal joint resource allocation and continuous UAV trajectory design. We aim at maximizing the information throughput between UAV and a ground user, while protecting the transmission behavior from being detected by a warden. Due to the continuity of UAV trajectory in both time and space, the formulated problem has infinitely large number of variables to be optimized, i.e., being not only cutting-edge, but also very challenging to be coped with. To address this issue, we provide an artificial potential field (APF)-based approach, with which a closed-form optimal solution is for the first time obtained for considered UAV-assisted covert communication. In particular, first based on investigation on the covertness constraint, the maximal transmit power is characterized as a closed-form binary decision function with respect to UAV position. Following the characterization, we then transform the joint optimization problem to one of pure UAV trajectory design. Subsequently, via conducting an APF to covert transmission rate between the UAV and the user, the trajectory design problem is completely equivalent to a mechanical problem, i.e., a density-variable rope shape design problem in the APF, based on mechanical equivalence technique. Such mechanical problem can be optimally solved. Specifically, the force field in the conducted APF corresponding to a covert communication is actually twisted due to the presence of the warden, for which we reorganize a brand new mechanical analysis process accordingly, including reanalyzing the direction of the force field and updating the force balance expression. Then, according to the minimum total potential energy principle, the closed-form solution of the optimal rope shape is constructed following the equilibrium analysis. In addition, acknowledging that the lowest potential point of APF changes with the covert requirement, we also discuss all the three cases for optimal trajectory distinguishing in hovering behavior of the UAV.},

  abstract={This article investigates a dual-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted short-packet covert communication system in the presence of a warden. Specifically, one flying UAV serves as the base station to transmit covert information to a legitimate ground user, and the other flying UAV is deployed as a cooperative jammer to transmit artificial noise against detection by a warden. Considering a more practical scenario, where only imperfect location information of the warden is known at both UAVs, we jointly optimize both UAVs’ transmit powers and 3-D trajectories to maximize the average covert transmission rate under the constraints of both UAVs’ mobility, transmit powers and warden’s detection error probability (DEP). On the one hand, the incomplete Gamma function involved in warden’s DEP makes the covertness constraint intractable for further analysis. To facilitate the design, warden’s DEP is lower bounded by Pinsker’s inequality. On the other hand, the formulated optimization problem is intractable to solve directly owing to the multiple highly coupled variables and the uncertainty of the warden’s location. The alternating optimization algorithm combined with the successive convex approximation and  $\mathcal {S}$ -procedure techniques is leveraged to solve three optimization subproblems iteratively. Numerical results reveal that superior performance can be achieved by employing the proposed joint optimization of both UAVs’ transmit powers and 3-D trajectories algorithm compared with the traditional 2-D trajectory optimization algorithm and the scheme without the assistance of the cooperative UAV.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can provide wireless access to terrestrial users, regardless of geographical constraints, and will be an important part of future communication systems. In this article, a multi-user downlink dual-UAVs enabled covert communication system was investigated, in which a UAV transmits critical information to ground users in the presence of multiple wardens as well as a friendly jammer UAV transmits artificial jamming signals to fight with the wardens. The scenario of wardens being outfitted with a single antenna is considered, and the detection error probability (DEP) of wardens with finite observations is researched. Then, considering the uncertainty of wardens' location, a robust optimization problem with worst-case covertness constraint is formulated to maximize the average covert rate by jointly optimizing power allocation and trajectory. To cope with the optimization problem, an algorithm based on successive convex approximation methods is proposed. Thereafter, the results are extended to the case where all the wardens are equipped with multiple antennas. After analyzing the DEP in this scenario, a tractable lower bound of the DEP is obtained by utilizing Pinsker's inequality. Subsequently, the nonconvex optimization problem was established and efficiently coped by utilizing a similar algorithm as in the single-antenna scenario. Numerical results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.},

  abstract={This paper addresses the path planning problem for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), where a UAV serves as a messenger to periodically traverse over road-constrained ground vehicles (GVs) to relay information. The GVs may not move on the road network with the velocities agreed with the UAV due to their movement uncertainties. The UAV path planning problem can be formulated as the Dynamic Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Uncertain Neighborhood (DDTSPUN). To address the uncertainty in GVs motion, we define robust neighborhoods and corridors and prove that the UAV visiting these areas can revisit GVs reliably, thus transforming DDTSPUN into a Revisit-time-constrained Dubins Traveling Salesman Problem with Neighborhood (RDTSPN). To address the RDTSPN, we propose an online heuristic path planning algorithm. This algorithm incorporates a gradient-based method for visiting robust neighborhoods and a sampling-based search strategy along robust corridors to obtain the Dubins paths of UAV that achieve the robust visit for each GV. Finally, computational experiments demonstrate its advantage over other benchmark algorithms in obtaining the shortest path satisfying UAV curvature constraints, and ensuring robust access to all GVs.},

  abstract={The combination of nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides an effective solution for achieving massive connections and improving spectrum efficiency. However, the related security risk becomes serious due to the line-of-sight (LoS) channels involved and high transmit power for weaker users in NOMA-UAV networks. In this article, a UAV-assisted NOMA transmission scheme is proposed to achieve secure downlink transmission via artificial jamming, where a UAV flies straightly to serve multiple ground users in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. During the flight, only the closest NOMA users are chosen to connect with the UAV in each time slot to achieve high LoS probability. To balance the security and transmission performance, the tradeoff between the jamming power and the sum rate is investigated by jointly optimizing the power allocation, the user scheduling and the UAV trajectory. The formulated problem is mixed-integer and nonconvex due to the coupled variables. To address this, we first decompose the problem into two subproblems of power allocation and trajectory optimization. Then, they are transformed into convex ones via the first-order Taylor expansion. After that, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the convex problem. Finally, numerical results show that the security of the network is well enhanced and verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

This paper investigates a UAV assisted relaying communication system where a buffer-aided UAV acts as an aerial mobile relay to aid the information transmission between ground terminal nodes in the presence of malicious jamming. For the maximum end-to-end throughput, this paper formulates the optimization problem of joint communication scheduling, transmit power allocation and UAV trajectory planning under the buffer constraints. However, the non-convexity of the optimization problem will lead it to be intractable to obtain an optimal solution at an acceptable complexity, hence an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed to achieve an approximate suboptimal solution of the original problem. Numerical results not only demonstrate the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithm, but also indicate that the proposed joint design can considerably enhance the system throughput.},

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become crucial tools for post-disaster rescue and equipment inspection, offering significant social value. However, this demands exceptional navigation capabilities from UAVs in unknown and noisy environments. This paper proposes a novel robust path planning strategy to address the challenges faced by UAVs navigating in such conditions. The strategy integrates an image denoising module, ALSP-ID, which calculates similarity weights using Euclidean distance and vectorized representation. This effectively removes noise from depth maps while preserving edge information. By constructing an end-to-end network architecture, the perception and planning functions are trained simultaneously, reducing computational resource requirements. Additionally, the introduction of a channel attention mechanism allows the network to better focus on critical feature channels, enhancing the model's expressive ability and generalization performance. Experiments firmly validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving path planning robustness, path smoothness, and obstacle avoidance capabilities. Notably, it excels in handling noise and adapting to unknown environments, providing strong technical support for the autonomous navigation of UAVs in complex scenarios.},

APF-SA modifies the attractive and repulsive potential functions and leverages simulated annealing to escape local minimum and converge to globally optimal solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the effectiveness of APFSA, enabling efficient autonomous path planning for UAVs with obstacle avoidance.},

  abstract={The mobile relaying technique is a critical enhancing technology in wireless communications due to a higher chance of supporting the remote user from the base station (BS) with better service quality. This paper investigates energy-efficient (EE) mobile relaying networks mounted on the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) while the unknown adversaries try to intercept the legitimate link. We aim to optimize robust transmit power, both UAV and BS along, with relay hovering path, speed, and acceleration. The BS sends legitimate information, which is forwarded to the user by the relay. This procedure is defined as information-causality-constraint (ICC). We jointly optimize the worst-case secrecy rate (WCSR) and UAV propulsion energy consumption (PEC) for a finite time horizon. We construct the BS-UAV, the UAV-user, and the UAV-adversary channel models. We apply the UAV PEC considering UAV speed and acceleration. We derive EE UAV relay-user maximization problem in the adversarial wireless networks at last. While the problem is non-convex, we propose an iterative and sub-optimal algorithm to optimize EE UAV relay with constraints, such as ICC, trajectory, speed, acceleration, and transmit power. First, we optimize both BS and UAV transmit power and hovering speed for known UAV path planning and acceleration. Using the optimal transmit power and speed, we obtain the optimal trajectory and acceleration. We compare our algorithm with existing algorithms and demonstrate the improved EE UAV relaying communication for our model.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is of crucial importance in realizing heterogeneous practical wireless application scenarios. However, the densely populated users and diverse services with high data rate demands has triggered an increasing scarcity of UAV spectrum utilization. To tackle this problem, it is promising to incorporate the underutilized unlicensed spectrum with the licensed spectrum to boost network capacity. However, the openness of unlicensed spectrum makes UAVs susceptible to security threats from potential jammers. Therefore, a spectrum sharing UAV network coexisting with licensed cellular network and unlicensed Wi-Fi network is considered with the anti-jamming technique in this paper. The sum rate maximization of the secondary network is studied by jointly optimizing the transmit power, subchannel allocation, and UAV trajectory. We first decompose the challenging non-convex problem into two subproblems, 1) the joint power and subchannel allocation and 2) UAV trajectory design subproblems. A low-complexity iterative algorithm is proposed in a alternating optimization manner over these two subproblems to solve the formulated problem. Specifically, the Lagrange dual decomposition is exploited to jointly optimize the transmit power and subchannel allocation iteratively. Then, an efficient iterative algorithm capitalizing on successive convex approximation is designed to get a suboptimal solution for UAV trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can significantly improve the sum transmission rate compared with the benchmark schemes.},

  abstract={In this paper, we investigate a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled secure communication system. Two UAVs are applied in this system where one UAV moves around to communicate with multiple users on the ground using orthogonal time-division multiple access while the other UAV in the area jams the eavesdroppers on the ground to protect communications of the desired users. Specifically, we maximize the minimum worst-case secrecy rate among the users within each period by jointly adjusting UAV trajectories and user scheduling under the maximum UAV speed constraints, the UAV return constraints, the UAV collision avoidance constraints, and the discrete binary constraints on user scheduling variables. Since the resulting optimization problem is very difficult to solve due to its highly nonlinear objective function and nonconvex constraints, we first equivalently transform it into a more tractable problem. In particular, the binary constraints are equivalently converted to a number of equality constraints. Then, we develop a novel joint optimization algorithm to handle the converted problem. In order to further improve the secrecy rate performance, we also extend the developed algorithm to the case with multiple jamming UAVs. The simulation results show that the proposed joint optimization algorithm achieves significantly better performance than the conventional algorithms.},

  abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used in wireless communications due to their low cost, small size, flexible deployment, and mobile controllability. However, because of the Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication links, the security threat is always a challenging problem to deal with. In particular, information stolen and leakage may happen in the presence of eavesdroppers. This article proposes a UAV-enabled system with a relay UAV and a jammer UAV, and certain mobile source and destination nodes in the presence of an eavesdropper to solve the secrecy rate maximization problem. In this system, the relay UAV transmits information between pairs of moving source nodes and moving destination nodes with interrupted communication channels due to blockage or long distance, and the jammer UAV interferes with eavesdropper to reduce the milked information through sending jamming signals. We establish an average secrecy rate maximization problem with trajectory and transmit power optimization under certain constraints for this system. Since this problem is nonconvex and reformulated as the Markov decision process (MDP), we use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method to solve it. In this article, we adopt a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to find an optimal solution because it can deal with the model of continuous action space. According to our defined states, rewards, and actions in this specified MDP, this algorithm can autonomously learn to optimize the trajectory and power allocation of the UAVs to realize our goal. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PPO-based average secrecy rate maximization algorithm is valid, effective and scalable.},

  abstract={Muti-UAV System has the characteristics of complex system, and its survivability is affected by location dependability. Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS) is usually used by low-cost cooperative Multi-UAV system, which is easily being cheated when there are some GPS jammers, especially when there is a deception GPS jammer. Meanwhile Multi-UAV system can improve the responsibility of location by communication, which is also easily being disturbed and cheated. Aiming at the location safety problem of multi-UAV system under deceitful and interferential environment, a new Tri-Layer Trust Model (TLTM) has been established in this paper. In view of the characteristic of multi-UAV's cooperation, there is transaction layer, rating layer and communication layer in TLTM. The trust model can be computed through information of demander, tenderer and the third party. Meanwhile, the best cooperated partner will be selected through the results. The introducing of communication layer simulates the real condition of UAV system under deceitful and interferential information. When there is GPS jammer and communication jamming, it can also provide a safety decision method for multi-UAV system. Simulation results verify that this method could afford a reliable mean of location under deceitful and interferential environment.},

  abstract={Recently autonomous and semi-autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms started to receive a lot of research interest and demand from various civil application fields. However, for a successful mission execution UAV swarms require Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals and in particular Global Positioning System (GPS) signals for navigation. Unfortunately, civil GPS signals are unencrypted and unauthenticated, which facilitates the execution of GPS spoofing attacks. During these attacks adversaries mimic the authentic GPS signal and broadcast it to the targeted UAV in order to change its course, force it to land or crash. In this study, we propose a GPS spoofing detection mechanism capable of detecting single-transmitter and multi-transmitter GPS spoofing attacks to prevent the above mentioned outcomes. Our detection mechanism is based on comparing the distance between each two swarm members calculated from their GPS coordinates to the distance acquired from Impulse Radio Ultra-Wideband ranging between the same swarm members. If the difference in distances is larger than a chosen threshold the GPS spoofing attack is declared detected.},

  abstract={High altitude platforms (HAPs) are emerging as the critical enabler for the next generation communication system, due to their broad coverage, long endurance and high payload. However, the open and broadcast nature of wireless links makes HAP system susceptible to information eavesdropping. This paper investigates the secure downlink transmission for an HAP network, where one unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jammer is utilized against multiple mobile eavesdroppers (Eves) with imperfect location information. We aim to maximize the minimum average secrecy rate (MASR) by jointly optimizing subcarrier scheduling, subcarrier power allocation, UAV trajectory and HAP deployment. To address the formulated mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem, we first derive the optimal HAP deployment and utilize an estimation error model to resolve the locational uncertainty of the Eves. Subsequently, a low-complexity iterative algorithm is proposed, which decomposes the problem into three manageable subproblems and iteratively solves them to obtain a near-optimal solution. The convergence and complexity of the algorithm are further analyzed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves not only the MASR but also the fairness between terminal devices, which outperforms the baselines without resource allocation and/or trajectory optimization.},

  abstract={This paper analyzes and compares different visual-inertial (V-INS) sensor fusion strategies, conceived to enable GNSS-resilient navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). The strategies share the same data fusion architecture, based on a loosely coupled Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), but have variable characteristics concerning the image processing and pose estimation pipelines. Specifically, four different geolocation strategies are investigated to retrieve range information about the detected visual features in the observed scene, exploiting a flat Earth assumption, a local flat Earth assumption, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) intersection and a triangulation method, respectively. The latter approach, in particular, does not require any geometrical assumption or any a priori knowledge on the observed scene. Furthermore, an original approach to provide the EKF with a consistent estimate of the covariance associated to the visual-based pose solution is proposed. The navigation performance is evaluated by means of numerical simulations reproducing a straight trajectory with hovering and a curved trajectory, both over an almost flat and a mountain scenario. In the best case of the flat scenario, the percentage error on the position estimate, computed with respect to the UAV traveled distance, is less than 0.15%, and the error on the attitude angles estimate is less than 0.08°, while the Root Mean Square (RMS) values of the same quantities are about 0.09% and 0.04°, respectively. In the mountain scenario the performance is degraded but the maximum errors are still kept approximately within 1% and 1o, respectively.},

  abstract={Owing to the easy deployment and mobile flexibility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) assisted Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) has been deemed as one potential technology for handling the computation-intensive tasks at terminal devices (TDs). In this work, a MEC architecture assisted by UAVs is designed which achieves efficient offloading, computing, and downloading for tasks from multiple TDs via aerial to aerial collaboration of two UAVs. In this architecture, the task offloading process contains two parts, i.e., the offloading from TDs to a mobile UAV which flies around TDs, and the offloading from the mobile UAV to a hovering UAV which hovers in the air. The computing tasks from TDs will be divided into three parts allocated to the TDs themselves, and both two UAVs. Upon completion of computation, the computation results are downloaded to the TDs. The optimization objective is to seek for an optimal task division strategy to attain the weighted total energy consumption minimization for all devices. Since the formulated optimization problem is not convex, we develop a two-step iteration algorithm which jointly optimizes computing frequency, task allocation volume, as well as UAV's trajectory based on the method of block coordinate descent. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness and performance advantages of the designed algorithm.},

  abstract={Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are fundamental in ubiquitously providing position and time to a wide gamut of systems. Jamming remains a realistic threat in many deployment settings, civilian and tactical. Specifically, in drones sustained denial raises safety critical concerns. This work presents a strategy that allows detection, localization, and classification both in the frequency and time domain of interference signals harmful to navigation. A high-performance Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) drone with a single antenna and a commercial GNSS receiver is used to geolocate and characterize RF emitters at long range, to infer the navigation impairment. Raw IQ baseband snapshots from the GNSS receiver make the application of spectral correlation methods possible without extra software-defined radio payload, paving the way to spectrum identification and monitoring in airborne platforms, aiming at RF situational awareness. Live testing at Jammertest, in Norway, with portable, commercially available GNSS multi-band jammers demonstrates the ability to detect, localize, and characterize harmful interference. Our system pinpointed the position with an error of a few meters of the transmitter and the extent of the affected area at long range, without entering the denied zone. Additionally, further spectral content extraction is used to accurately identify the jammer frequency, bandwidth, and modulation scheme based on spectral correlation techniques.},

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are vulnerable to several threats that lead to security problems, such as stealing video footage, artificial signal interference, jamming and spoofing. Any system that rely on satellite positioning technology can be targeted by spoofing to generate incorrect positioning / timing, which is accomplished by inserting false signals into the victim's receiver. For example, the attacker inserts different positioning coordinates in the system that will hijack or distract security / safety in airspace surveillance. The civil aircraft's signal is not unencrypted and easily spoofed. When spoofing occurs, the target UAV deviates from the original path, and the UAV flies to the target point. Hence, this paper investigates the preliminary effects of spoofing signals on a Garmin GPSMAP 66SR handheld GNSS receiver and a DJI Phantom UAV. The test was conducted via field measurements at an open area with GNSS spoofing signals generated using a GNSS simulator with increasing power levels from −140 to −95 dBm. It was found that the GNSS receiver was spoofed at −116 dBm, while for the UAV, the spoofing signal affected the navigation system as it showed abnormal operation and had to be flown using optical mode for navigation during the spoofing period and changed back to GNSS mode.},

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become indispensable across domains such as surveillance, disaster management, and industrial inspection. However, their heavy reliance on Global Positioning System (GPS) signals exposes them to spoofing, jamming, and denial-of-service attacks, creating significant risks in critical operations. To address this limitation, we propose a secure vision-based navigation framework that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and efficient path-planning algorithms. A lightweight UNet architecture with a ResNet50 backbone was trained on aerial datasets, achieving a Dice coefficient of 0.9155 and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8658, enabling robust segmentation of roads, buildings, terrain, and obstacles. SLAM, powered by SuperPoint feature detection and SuperGlue matching, demonstrated reduced drift and improved trajectory consistency compared to classical ORBbased methods. Path-planning experiments further showed that A* consistently outperformed Dijkstra in real-time navigation scenarios. The integration of CNN-driven perception with SLAMbased localization provides reliable cost-fused maps for autonomous decision-making. This framework enhances confidentiality, integrity, and availability in UAV navigation, offering a scalable GPS-independent solution for secure deployment in contested and GPS-denied environments.},

  abstract={This article investigates the covert performance of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jammer-assisted cognitive radio (CR) network. In particular, the covert transmission of secondary users can be effectively protected by UAV jamming against the eavesdropping. For practical consideration, the UAV is assumed to only know certain partial channel distribution information (CDI), whereas not to know the detection threshold of an eavesdropper. For this sake, we propose a model-driven generative adversarial network (MD-GAN)-assisted optimization framework, consisting of a generator and a discriminator, where the unknown channel information and the detection threshold are learned weights. Then, a GAN-based joint trajectory and power optimization (GAN-JTP) algorithm is developed to train the MD-GAN optimization framework for covert communication, which results in the joint solution of the UAV’s trajectory and transmits power to maximize the covert rate and the probability of detection errors. Our simulation results show that the proposed GAN-JTP with a rapid convergence speed can attain near-optimal solutions of the UAV’s trajectory and transmit power for the covert communication.},

  abstract={Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely used to ensure the security of wireless communications. In this paper, we propose a cooperative jamming scheme to secure cognitive radio (CR) networks. In the proposed scheme, the source UAV transmits confidential information to ground users. Because of the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve), the UAV jammer sends friendly interference signals to protect private information. It should be noted that the primary transmission of CR networks cannot be disturbed. Therefore, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average secrecy rate under the constraint of primary interference. Since trajectory planning and power control are coupled, we propose the alternative optimization (AO) algorithm. Furthermore, as the sub-problems are non-convex, sequential convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is a good choice, which makes our scheme converge to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point. Simulation results show that the joint optimization of power and trajectory of our proposed scheme is effective for improving the systematic secure performance.},

  abstract={We investigate in this article joint trajectory design and resource allocation for secure air–ground integrated Internet of Things (IoT) networks with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jamming and device-to-device (D2D) enhancement. By jointly optimizing ground user (GU) scheduling, UAV flight trajectory, and transmit power, we are able to maximize the minimum system secrecy rate of UAV and D2D communications. The formulated optimization problems of the two typical network scenarios, i.e., with and without UAV jamming, are challenging to be solved due to the corresponding nonsmooth and nonconcave objective functions. Therefore, we propose alternating iterative algorithms to solve the problems by employing the successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent methods. Extensive results indicate that the proposed joint optimization schemes can effectively improve the secrecy communication performance under different spatial distributions of GUs.},

  abstract={A path planning algorithm for drone swarms is presented. From the outset, none of the drones knows the path and final destination. Together, they collectively determine and unravel step-by-step the waypoints and final destination, resolving a localization problem at each step. It is a shared-information path planning algorithm. The algorithm is fault-tolerant and resilient to drones falling victim of attacks to their positioning system. It is shown that correctly functioning drones navigate the path provided that the number of faulty drones is less than $\frac{n-d}{2}$, where $n$ is the total number of drones and $d$, equal to two or three, is the dimension of the space navigated by the drones. We validate the algorithm with appropriate simulations, implemented over OMNeT++ and GNSSim, which allow building network simulations including GPS attacks (e.g., jamming and spoofing attacks). The OMNeT++ models and GNSSim functions are linked together.},

  abstract={The application of NOMA in UAV networks is an effective solution for communications. However, the security risk becomes more serious with the LoS channels and higher transmit power for weaker users in NOMA-UAV networks. In this paper, a UAV-assisted NOMA transmission scheme is proposed to achieve secure downlink transmission via artificial jamming, where a UAV flies straightly to serve multiple ground users in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. Only the closest users to the UAV can be connected in each time slot to achieve high LoS probability. To balance the security and transmission performance, the tradeoff between the jamming power and the sum rate is investigated by jointly optimizing the power allocation, the user scheduling and the UAV trajectory. To address the problem, we first decompose the problem into two subproblems of power allocation and trajectory optimization. Then, they are transformed into convex ones for an iterative algorithm via the first-order Taylor expansion. Finally, simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology, UAVs have demonstrated significant potential in communication assistance. However, the dynamic nature of wireless channels and evolving security threats pose significant challenges to maintaining secrecy in UAV-assisted communications. To solve the related issues, a dual-UAV-enabled cooperative jamming method based on an enhanced QMIX is proposed for energy-efficient secure communications. Specifically, an optimization problem is formulated to simultaneously maximize the secrecy rate while minimizing the energy consumption during the flight. Subsequently, the optimization problem is projected to the Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDP), and the enhanced QMIX algorithm is proposed as the solution with the prioritized experience replay and the multi-agent cooperation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves communication secrecy while maintaining low energy consumption, proving its effectiveness and scalability in dynamic environments.},

  abstract={Drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly popular, thus posing danger and threats to infrastructures and public safety. A technology for drone detection and classification would therefore significantly increase the level of security. In scenarios such as concerts, sport events, trade fairs, or in any situation where significant aggregation of people is present, such techniques should be non-invasive. That means they do not have to pose an additional threat to people themselves. To this end, passive radars offer an appealing solution, since they are able to offer a non-cooperative surveillance while not emitting any electromagnetic signal. On the contrary, they rely on existing transmitting infrastructure (also referred to as illuminators of opportunity, IoO), such as broadcasting signal sources (FM radio, terrestrial and satellite digital video broadcasting, cellular communication and so on). In this work, the possibility to exploit satellite television based passive radar for UAV detection is analyzed by experimental validation. In addition, micro-Doppler signatures for drones have been extracted, which might give information for subsequent UAV classification.},

Numerical simulation results substantiate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through the comparison with benchmark methods, and the proposed scheme is proven to achieve a significant improvement in terms of average secrecy rate in various operating conditions.},

  abstract={With the evolutional development of maritime networks, the explosive growth of maritime data has put forward elevated demands for the computing capabilities of maritime devices (MDs). Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is able to alleviate the computing pressure of MDs by forwarding the computing tasks to the edge server on the coast. However, UAV relaying introduces a significant security challenge due to the vulnerability of line-of-sight (LoS) communication channels, which can be exploited for eavesdropping on computing tasks. In this paper, an efficient secure communication scheme is proposed for UAV-relay-assisted maritime mobile edge computing (MEC) with a flying eavesdropper. The secure computing capacity of MDs is maximized by jointly optimizing the transmit power, time slot allocation factor, computation optimization and UAV trajectory. Due to multi-variable coupling, the formulated optimization problem (OP) is non-convex. We first transform OP by introducing auxiliary variables. Then, the transformed OP is decomposed and solved in an iterative manner by applying block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Numerical results show that the secure computing capability of the UAV-relay-assisted maritime MEC system of proposed secure communication scheme can be effectively improved compared with benchmarks.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm is widely used in tasks such as post-disaster rescue and battle-field monitoring. These tasks are often executed in unknown or complex environments, necessitating the programming of safe and efficient paths for UAV swarm to ensure the completion of missions. To address the path planning problem for UAV swarm in unknown electromagnetic environment, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm based on environment sensing where a safe learning mechanism is designed by using control barrier function. Additionally, a weakly supervised learning-based generative adversarial network algorithm is employed to construct an electromagnetic environment sensing module. By using the algrothim we propose, UAV swarm can avoid zones with strong electromagnetic interference and guarantee inter-UAV collisions avoidance during task execution. Compared to reinforcement learning algorithm without environment sensing module and safe learning mechanism, the algorithm we propose reduces convergence time by approximately 2.5 times. Simultaneously, it prevents individual trial-and-error learning process from violating safety constraints, ensuring the safety of UAV swarm in unknown environment. Finally, we verified the effectiveness of our algorithm on the experimental platform which is constructed by using universal software radio peripherals and quadcopter UAVs.},

  abstract={Owing to the flexible mobility and convenient deployment, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided networks can facilitate many applications. However, the open accessibility of wireless communication brings a great risk of privacy to UAV-based networks. Thus, in this paper, we propose a UAV-aided covert communication scheme assisted by a multi-antenna jammer to maximize the transmission rate between a ground transmitter and a UAV receiver against several randomly distributed wardens. The transmitter adopts the maximum ratio transmission, while the jammer zero-forces its transmitted signal at the UAV to disturb the monitoring at wardens without interfering the legitimate transmission. First, we analyze the detection performance and derive the optimal threshold for each warden to minimize its detection outage probability (DOP). Then, with the worst situation in which all wardens set their respective optimal thresholds to achieve the minimum global DOP, the location and the transmit power of the jammer are optimized to maximize the DOP. The location of UAV and the transmit power of the ground transmitter are also optimized to maximize the transmission rate with the minimum DOP requirement satisfied. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UAV-aided covert communication scheme.},

  abstract={In this paper, we study a novel joint information-theoretic secrecy and covertness model for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted finite blocklength transmission system, in which an UAV delivers classified information to a ground user (Bob) in the presence of two unauthorized users (Eve and Willie). Specifically, Eve tries to decode the legitimate information while Willie tries to detect if the UAV's transmission is present or not. Firstly, we assume that the perfect location knowledge of both Eve and Willie is known at the UAV. In this scenario, to guarantee security and covertness, the average secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated via joint design of the UAV's transmit power and three dimensional (3D) trajectory under Willie's covertness constraint. Technically speaking, the optimization problem is non-convex and mathematically intractable to tackle owing to the coupling of multiple variables. To address this non-convex problem, an iterative alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed with the assistance of the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. After that, we extend the system model to both Eve's and Willie's imperfect location knowledge case, which is more sophisticated compared to the perfect location knowledge case due to the uncertain location constraints. We still utilize the iterative AO algorithm combined with SCA and $\mathcal {S}$-procedure techniques to cope with the nonconvex problem. Numerical results indicate that our proposed 3D optimization algorithm performs better than the conventional two dimensional (2D) scheme and the benchmark scheme for both perfect and imperfect location knowledge cases.},

  abstract={The collaboration between MEC and UAVs has introduced groundbreaking opportunities for effective data processing and computation services in the domain of the IoT. Despite this advancement, the existence of an active eavesdropper introduces notable security vulnerabilities to the computation process of MDs. This research presents an effective strategy designed to reduce energy consumption in a secure WEB 3.0-driven resource allocation and trajectory optimization in UAV-Assisted MEC Networks that faces the challenge of a UAV eavesdropper to ensure transparent and tamper-resistant forensic records, enabling trust and accountability. By guaranteeing secure computation of all MDs data, the network attains its desired energy consumption targets through optimization of trajectories and resources, considering factors such as time, local computation, and offloading computation distribution. A WEB 3.0, blockchain-based forensic is used to address this issue because standard approaches are ineffective. Results from simulations exhibit that the proposed strategy surpasses the benchmark in lowering the network’s energy consumption and cyber threats.

  abstract={The downlink communications are vulnerable to intelligent unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) jamming attack. In this paper, we propose a novel anti-intelligent UAV jamming strategy, in which the ground users can learn the optimal trajectory to elude such jamming. The problem is formulated as a stackelberg dynamic game, where the UAV jammer acts as a leader and the ground users act as followers. First, as the UAV jammer is only aware of the incomplete channel state information (CSI) of the ground users, for the first attempt, we model such leader sub-game as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Then, we obtain the optimal jamming trajectory via the developed deep recurrent Q-networks (DRQN) in the three-dimension space. Next, for the followers sub-game, we use the Markov decision process (MDP) to model it. Then we obtain the optimal communication trajectory via the developed deep Q-networks (DQN) in the two-dimension space. We prove the existence of the stackelberg equilibrium and derive the closed-form expression for the stackelberg equilibrium in a special case. Moreover, some insightful remarks are obtained and the time complexity of the proposed defense strategy is analyzed. The simulations show that the proposed defense strategy outperforms the benchmark strategies.},

Assuming UAVs have partial information about eavesdropper's location, we propose two transmission schemes: friendly UAV jamming (FUJ) and Gaussian jamming transmission (GJT) for the cases when jamming signals are known and unknown a priori at destination, respectively. Then, we formulate an average secrecy rate maximization problem to jointly optimize the transmission power and trajectory of UAVs, and the power splitting ratio of destination. Being non-convex and hence difficult to solve the formulated problem, we propose a computationally efficient iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation to obtain a suboptimal solution. Finally, numerical results are provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed multiple-UAV schemes, compared to other existing benchmarks. Specifically, we find that the FUJ demonstrates significant secrecy performance improvement in terms of the optimal instantaneous and average secrecy rate compared to the GJT and the conventional single-UAV counterpart.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided augmented reality (AR) has developed rapidly in recent years and has become a promising technology in disaster rescue, transportation, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. However, the information leakage is challenging the usage of UAV-aided AR systems with wireless communications. In this article, a dual UAVs assisted covert communication system (CCS) is proposed, where one UAV transmits the covert message to ground receivers and a cooperative UAV performs as a jammer to interfere with the malicious eavesdropper. However, flying UAVs result in fast channel fading between the UAVs and ground nodes, which reduces the covert rate of the CCSs. To maximize the average covert rate, we formulated a non-convex optimization problem under the constraint that the detection error probability (DEP) of the monitor is minimum. Furthermore, the problem is decomposed into three subproblems and transformed into convex, and these subproblems are solved alternately by designing an iterative algorithm. Simulation results reveal that the average covert rate performance of the proposed optimization algorithm can respectively achieve 16% and 40% gains than those without covert constraint and without the cooperative UAV used as a jammer.},

  abstract={In this article, we investigate the design of the trajectory of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the transmit power of ground users to improve covert communications against a flying warden in UAV-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access networks, where the legitimate UAV can simultaneously collect the messages from the multiple ground users in a secure manner. Taking the channel uncertainty into account, we derive the analytical expressions of the optimal normalized detection threshold, the minimum detection error probability (DEP), and the security-guaranteed transmit power constraint for the ground users that are exploited to ensure a high DEP at the warden UAV. Subsequently, the design to maximize the average covert achievable rate (CAR) subject to the constraints of flight speed, initial and final locations, transmit power, and detection performance is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem. To obtain a high-quality solution to the design problem at hand, an iterative block coordinate descent-based successive convex approximation method is proposed. From the theoretical analysis, we find that a greater channel estimation uncertainly or a lower effective received power ratio at the warden UAV is beneficial in enhancing the system covertness towards the warden UAV. Moreover, when the successful detection probability of the warden UAV is sufficiently small, the maximum effective received power ratio is linearly and positively correlated to the detection success probability. Besides, extensive simulations are presented to verify the covert performance advantages brought by the proposed method.},

  abstract={The evolving landscape of beyond 5G and 6G wireless communication systems in smart urban environments faces numerous interference-related challenges posed by legitimate and illicit devices. In this context, Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) have emerged as a promising solution to mitigate interference caused by obstacles and unknown jamming devices. Existing techniques mainly focus on mitigating the impact of a single jammer in IRS-assisted communications systems, which affects both stationary and mobile devices. Additionally, these approaches target a single objective, such as minimizing the energy, enhancing the transmission rate, or maximizing the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), which restrains the performance of the system. This paper offers a comprehensive anti-jamming solution for securing wireless communications in a smart city urban environment comprising diverse public events such as sporting events, parades, festivals, and exhibitions. The focus is on maintaining essential services like security, law enforcement, logistics, emergency response, crowd management, and public health. We introduce a Reinforcement Learning-based technique for UAV-mounted IRS, optimizing trajectory and phase shift beamforming to counteract the disruptive impact of jammers, ensuring reliable communication in dynamic, security-sensitive settings Our approach also seeks to achieve multi-objective optimization by striking a balance between transmission rate and energy consumption in this highly challenging environment. The formulated optimization is computationally complex due to its combinatorial nature. Hence, we leverage the light-weight Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) technique called Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to optimize trajectory and IRS phase shifts and achieve multiple objectives jointly. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DDPG-based approach in outperforming other RL algorithms. It achieves a near-optimal solution compared to the benchmark technique within the close gap and improves both achievable transmission rates and energy efficiency compared to related works by 50-70%.},

  abstract={The vigorous development of maritime networks and the explosive growth of maritime sampling data put forward more and more high demands on the computing and communication capability of maritime equipment. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), as the mobile relay device guarantees the capability by transferring part of the computing tasks of maritime equipment to carrying mobile edge computing (MEC) servers on land. However, the transmitting data of the UAV's communication channel can be easily intercepted due to the line of sight (LoS) feature, which brings the secure data transmission issue. To solve this issue, we propose a secure data transmission scheme in the UAV-relay assisted maritime MEC system. Specifically, a malicious UAV attempts to intercept the transmission data while another UAV helps forward the offloading computational data to the maritime surface users. A ground jammer transmits jamming signals with the object to block data intercepting. To maximize the users' minimum secure calculation capacity, we jointly optimize the transmit power of users and the relay UAV, the time slot allocation factor, and the UAV flight trajectory with block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Numerical findings demonstrate that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the secure calculation capability of the system compared with four benchmark schemes.},

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), particularly low-cost UAVs, have become increasingly important due to their wide range of applications and ease of use. However, with the rapid growth of the UAV market, the rising security concerns pose a greater risk. One such primary concern is location spoofing attacks which can compromise UAV's navigation system, making it crucial to analyze various location-based attacks. In this paper, we identify 16 such GPS spoofing scenarios based on environmental conditions, attack type, and spoof signal propagation path. We evaluate these scenarios based on various GPS parameters like Horizontal Dilution Of Precision (HDOP), Vertical Dilution Of Precision (VDOP), GPS satellite count in view, and avg signal-to-noise power density (CN0). We then analyze the variations in GPS parameters for various such attack scenarios. Further, we analyze the impact of distance on average CN0 and the effect of satellite count on effective spoofable distance. We also discuss several critical insights which are empirically observed during our experimental trials. Our experiments revealed that the natural conditions within indoor and outdoor scenarios can vary considerably, and effective spoofable distance can be up to 100 meters when the satellite count is less than 10.},

  abstract={With global coverage, high accuracy, and lightweight receivers, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has been the major positioning solution for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). However, GNSS is prone to electromagnetic interference and malicious attacks such as jamming or spoofing due to its low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To ensure the continuity and safety of UAV operation, the use of redundant navigation systems is crucial. Phased array radio system (PARS) has proven its potential as a local navigation solution in the last few years. PARS is robust against malicious attacks due to a significantly higher SNR than GNSS together with directional and encrypted transmission. One of the challenges of the PARS-based navigation is the radio antenna at ground station, as its orientation needs to be determined precisely to obtain accurate navigation solution for unmanned vehicles. This paper presents an automatic calibration algorithm for the ground radio antenna orientation using a multiplicative extended Kalman filter (MEKF) based on GNSS and PARS measurements. The calibration algorithm was tested with data obtained from a field test using a fixed wing UAV and validated by a residual analysis comparing the PARS- and GNSS-based positioning.},

This paper introduces an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) as a countermeasure against sensor’s attacks that leverages Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals, generated by the UAV Board. The IDS, positioned at the Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs), can potentially detect anomalies even when conventional ground station detections fail. Multiple unsupervised machine learning algorithms were evaluated for this purpose. The Local Factor Outlier (LOF) emerged as the most accurate with 75.87%, closely followed by One Class SVM (OCSVM) at 74.17%, and Isolation Forest (IF) at 71.59%.

Specifically, in a mobile relay system where a UAV relay is employed to forward confidential information between two ground users, an eavesdropper exists on the ground wiretapping the relay UAV. To enhance the security performance of the system, we introduce a friendly UAV jammer transmitting interference signals and confusing the eavesdropper.

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) relay can effectively improve the coverage and performance of land communications, which makes it prospective to be deployed in various applications. However, there exist some practical challenges we have to face in UAV-enabled communication system designing, such as secrecy and wiretapping threats due to the air-to-ground line-of-sight communication link, and energy consumption issues because of the limitation in energy-constraint. To deal with these two key issues, we develop a novel UAV swarm assisted multi-hop mobile relay system which can be applied in special scenarios with severe blockage or long distance to enhance communication performance. An effective cooperative transmission scheme is proposed to address the security issues in a physical layer security perspective, where several UAVs serve as multi-hop relays forwarding information between ground users and the other UAVs are employed as friendly jammers confusing the ground eavesdroppers. The minimum secrecy energy efficiency (MSEE), namely the minimum achievable secrecy rate per energy consumption unit over legitimate links, is designed as the performance indicator to quantify the secure and energy-efficient transmission. Subject to information-causality, transmit power, and mobility constraints, the UAV swarm assisted MSEE maximization transmission scheme is formulated into a complicated non-convex problem. To solve the non-convex fractional optimization problem, we decouple the original problem into sub-problems and further propose an efficient algorithm by applying the block coordinate descent method, successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques, and Dinkelbach method. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves considerable performance enhancement on MSEE compared with benchmark schemes.},

To this end, a proximal policy optimization (PPO) based framework is proposed. Specifically, under a realistic probabilistic line-of-sight (LoS) channel model, we derive the maximum achievable data transmission rate under interference and express its lower bound explicitly, considering coverage and sensing constraints. In order to tackle the non-convex dilemma and optimize communication throughput and energy utilization, the issue at hand is conceptualized as a Markov decision process (MDP) and a multidimensional reward function is set. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed frame-work in handling the data transmission task while reducing overall network energy consumption. The results indicate a total throughput improvement of 19.7% and a reduction of 46.3% in energy consumption compared to the baseline algorithm.},

Different from the classical UAV-assisted secure communication, we observe that there is a symmetry relation between the UAV-B and UAV-J. Based on this fact, we modify the original objective function. Specifically, we maximize the minimum worst-case system data rate among the users and eavesdroppers within each period by jointly adjusting UAV trajectories and user scheduling.

  abstract={A novel covert communication framework is proposed to enhance the privacy of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled relaying systems. Specifically, the full-duplex (FD) UAV covertly relays data from each ground sensor to remote base station (BS) against a warden (Willie). Considering a noise uncertainty model, the minimum detection error probability (DEP) of Willie is first derived. Under the constraint of the derived DEP, the minimum average covert transmission rate (ACTR) is then maximized by jointly designing the sensor association, the UAV transmit power, and the UAV trajectory. A low-complexity algorithm based on the penalty successive convex approximation (P-SCA) is further invoked to achieve the locally optimal solution. Finally, numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework and reveal some insights, i.e., increasing uncertainty at Willie can improve the covertness performance.},

  abstract={.The benefits of using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) platform to perform certain tasks include increased robustness in the system, greater flexibility, reduced cost, as well as an increase in the speed of task completion. By acting collectively, a team of UAVs can quickly determine the approximate location of intermittently broadcasting RF emitters with simple passive angle-of-arrival sensors. Passive ground emitter location techniques are vital to electronic warfare system (EWS) providing threat warnings in hostile environments. The paper focuses on proposing and evaluating solutions for optimizing the UAV trajectories for localization of a RF emitter using Line of Bearing (LOB) measurements. The optimization approach aims to minimize the size of the target position error ellipse. A framework using only the geometry of the problem is explored to minimize the maximal bounds of the emitters’ locations without using a belief or probability distribution needed for iterative approaches, which requires a good initial guess to ensure convergence on the true position. The effectiveness of the geometric approach is shown by designing and evaluating a global decision-making strategy based on Learning Real-Time A* (LRTA*) algorithm. Through simulations, the search solution is compared to a conventional optimal control solution approach for a two dimensional space case. The LRTA* solution achieves acceptable accuracy with sufficient observation points and it is suitable for real-time purposes. The solution is also attractive for its capability to initialize iterative algorithms if needed.},

  abstract={We propose JAM-ME, an autonomous jamming-assisted navigation system that allows a drone to accomplish its mission even in the presence of an anti-drone jamming protection system. In this contribution, we review the current state-of-the-art highlighting how current solutions to respond to drones are completely ineffective against JAM-ME. In particular, we introduce our solution and its theoretical framework, and later we relax a few constraints of the baseline model (adding wind drift, and allowing the target to be randomly placed within the jammed area). Moreover, we run extensive simulations that do support our findings: even under the combined action of jamming and wind drift, the drone can reach a target randomly deployed in the jamming area-any other drone, under the same conditions, would have simply failed. As per the overhead, under very conservative assumptions, JAM-ME experiences an average overhead of 70%; however, note that such overhead can be reduced by at least a tenfold factor in practical settings-discussed in the paper. Finally, we highlight the intrinsic limitations of our solution, potential countermeasures, and new jamming strategies that can pave the way to further research.},

  abstract={In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant popularity and are used for many applications, from entertainment to surveillance and the modern battlefield. As regulation demands arose worldwide, controling and reacting to unauthorized flights of UAVs became a pressing issue. In this work, we present an algorithm to accelerate the training of a reinforcement learning drone agent for a counter unmanned aerial system (C-UAS). The main objective of this C-UAS is to guide an invading drone to a safe-killing zone (SZ) using a hunter quadrotor drone. The hunter quadrotor launches a spoofing, or meaconing, attack on the GNSS receiver of the invading drone. The proposed algorithms employ an abstraction of the C-UAS problem to accelerate the training step and enable training during the mission. Results for different SZ radii are discussed using a software-in-the-loop simulation for ground truth based on a detailed model of the UAV embedded system and flight dynamics, including error metrics and action time. We show that a 99% probability of successful target steering to the SZ can be achieved considering a SZ radius of 75 meters and a Q-table trained with the proposed accelerated training model.},

  abstract={In this paper, physical layer security is considered for cognitive radio networks using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled jamming noise. In the studied model, a secondary transmitter sends confidential messages to a secondary receiver in the presence of an external eavesdropper (Eve), and the UAV acts as a friendly jammer that degrades the decoding capability of Eve. Therefore, resource allocation in such a network must jointly optimize the transmission power and UAV's trajectory to maximize the secrecy rate, while satisfying a given interference threshold at the primary receiver. The design problem is non-convex, and thus, global optimality is difficult to obtain. Aiming to solve this problem, we first transform it into a more tractable form, and then propose a successive convex approximation-based algorithm for its solutions. The proposed algorithm has a low computational complexity and is guaranteed to obtain at least a locally optimal solution of the original problem. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design, compared to the existing ones.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles play an important role in everyday life. In the last ten years, they have become part of routine operations that in the past were purely human activities. Drones are entering areas where the presence of humans would not be problematic, but where drone flights could be impaired. These include electromagnetic fields, high-frequency fields and the like. Drones are increasingly being used in the area of airport security and inspection, whether for the inspection of signalling and control equipment or for perimeter surveillance. When inspecting airport premises, there is a possibility that a drone may change its flight path in the vicinity of systems that emit strong radio or electromagnetic radiation while carrying out a flight mission. Such systems can be, for example, meteorological or airborne radar or ILS systems. In this paper, the effects of radiation from ILS (Instrument Landing System) antennas on the flight of UAVs in their vicinity are investigated. The results of the research aim to recommend flight methods based on the evaluation of measurements of radio effects on UAV flights in the vicinity of ILS antennas. The use of UAVs in airport infrastructure has a huge potential and therefore it is necessary to know the limitations of the use of UAS technology, the flight zones and the possible effects of environmental factors on the safety of flight and the accuracy of the measurements performed in the case of sensor data collection. The conclusions of the paper contribute to a better understanding of UAV flight zones in airport infrastructure, and based on the results, flight paths can be better determined in the future with respect to potential interference.},

  abstract={Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), either intentional or unintentional in nature, can have significant impact on the performance of systems utilizing GNSS receivers. It can therefore be beneficial for a commercial autonomous system to have the capability to detect the presence of RFI, and determine the source's position, speed and course over ground to potentially maneuver away from the affected region. Typical approaches involve deployment of complex infrastructure to measure different signal parameters making them cost-ineffective. Several low cost receivers have been proven a better alternative as they are capable to output the parameters required by the localization system. In this paper, a Carrier-to-Noise density ratio (C/N0) model, describing the variations of C/N0 measurements as a function of the distance between jammer and victim receiver is applied to a network of cooperating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to enable collaborative jammer localization. Two different techniques are studied, the first one is based on the synthetic array principle allowing jammer localization by a single node. In this paper, the original method is extended to a three-dimensional case. The second approach is based on combining the measurements obtained by all cooperating nodes. Both of the techniques are verified through simulations of a dynamic jammer and dynamic cooperating UAV network scenario in a controlled lab environment. The obtained results are discussed in terms of achieved accuracy as well as various factors impacting the performance of the approaches.},

  abstract={This paper studies the trade-off between the comunication capacity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and the UAV's unintentional interference in a shared spectrum scenario. In fact, UAV will also cause unintentional interference to other ground users (GUs) who do not communicate with the UAV while transmitting data to a specific ground node (GN). And the location of these GUs is usually unknown. For this problem, we introduce the concept of unacceptable area in which the interference power received by GUs from UAV exceeds their anti-jamming tolerance, and study the trade-off between UAV's average communication capacity and average unacceptable area by joint UAV's 3D trajectory and transmit power optimization. Further, we propose an effective iterative algorithm to solve this non-convex problem by using successive convex approximation (SCA) and block coordinate descent (BCD) method. Numerical results show the proposed scheme can meet the communication requirements of UAV and reduce the UAV's unintentional interference at the same time.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become widely available and their potential unlawful usage introduces new security risks. It has therefore become highly desirable to restrict the unauthorized usage of UAVs in certain areas such as airports, nuclear power plants, etc. Most commercially available UAVs rely on spread spectrum techniques, such as direct sequencing and frequency hopping, in the remote control systems to reduce the impact of interference from neighboring communication systems (including e.g. other remotely controlled UAVs), to increase resistance to jamming and to prevent detection. In this paper, an efficient protocol-aware UAV remote control jamming system is proposed and implemented using an open-source software defined radio (SDR) platform. Experimental results show that for FASST and ACCST remote control systems, the proposed jammer achieves successful jamming at relatively low jam-to-signal ratios (JSRs) as compared to a sweep jammer, therefore requiring less transmitted power to achieve similar results. Furthermore, the proposed jammer impacts other communication systems significantly less than the sweep jammer.},

To maximize the secrecy rate of the UAVs communication, an optimization problem has been proposed to jointly optimize the trajectory and transmit power. To enhance the obtained average secrecy rate, MIMO communication and a cooperative UAV jammer strategy were used in this paper. Also, analysis and simulations results were presented to show the performance of UAV-ground communication at THz communications. Finally, Secrecy Outage Probability was obtained for each UAV trajectories in different flight periods to examine the performance of physical layer security added to the UAV-ground communication at sub-THz communication.},

  abstract={The past few years have witnessed a remarkable leap forward in the tactical position of UAV swarm in aerial electronic warfare. Among them, energy-aware packet routing is one of the fundamental problems for cooperation between multiple UAVs to complete combat missions in complex battlefield environments. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique provides a new opportunity to networks related applications, including routing, resource allocation and network access. However, most existing DRL-based routing protocols are difficult to adapt to the changes of network scale, which have weak generalization capabilities and rely on centralized trainers. Thus, these protocols cannot be directly applied to the aerial electronic warfare. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and scalable routing protocol for UAV swarm electronic warfare with graph attention based fully distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning. Besides, a reward function design method based on fuzzy logic is proposed to reduce the probability of abnormal behaviors performed by agents. The simulation results show that our protocol can make effective routing decisions in dynamic wireless multihop networks and enhance the system performances in terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay and throughput.},

This group embarks on an autonomous patrol to localize and track the target with a specified accuracy, as quickly as possible. The challenge can be decomposed into two stages: 1) estimation of the target position given previous measurements (localization) and 2) planning the future trajectory of the tracking UAVs to get lower expected localization error given current estimation (path planning). For each stage, we compare two algorithms in terms of performance and computational load. For the localization stage, we compare a detection-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a recursive Bayesian estimator. For the path planning stage, we compare a steepest descent posterior Cramer–Rao lower bound path planning and a bioinspired heuristic path planning. Our results show that the steepest descent path planning outperforms the bioinspired path planning by an order of magnitude, and recursive Bayesian estimator narrowly outperforms detection-based EKF.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication is recognized as a promising technique in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to address the issue of ineffective transmission of road condition data and driving instructions caused by obstruction and random fading of ground channels. However, the inherently open channel characteristics in UAV to ground links brings new secure and covert problem in vehicular IoV which largely limit the applications of UAV in IoV. To resolve the issue, this work studies a UAV-enabled covert autonomous vehicular communication network where a UAV is deployed as a relay aided by a jammer to assist the data transmission from the base station to an autonomous vehicle without being detected by a warden whose exact location is unknown. For network performance boosting with transmission covertness consideration, an upload throughput maximization problem is formulated by jointly designing UAV trajectory and resource allocation under a more generally joint covertness constraints. To solve the complicated and highly non-convex problem which contains a large number of variables, we first analyze the detection performance and derives the closed-form expressions of the warden’s minimal detection error probability considering the warden’s location uncertainty. Then, the characterizations on the convexity of minimal detection error probability and the optimal transmission rate are provided, which helps in simplifying original problem and developing an efficient iterative algorithm to solve this problem based on a proposed novel convex approximation method. Simulations are offered to demonstrate the superior convergence, throughput, computation time, and covertness performance of proposed scheme in UAV-enabled vehicular network.},

  abstract={Cross-eye jamming represents an effective angle deception technique against monopulse seekers, capable of electromagnetic jamming against precision-guided weapons deployed on airborne platforms. While existing research primarily concentrates on minimizing the amplitude and phase tolerance of cross-eye jamming to enhance jammer performance, it often overlooks in-depth analysis of its practical combat application, leading to fragmented and nonspecific evaluations of its combat effectiveness. This study decouples the amplitude and phase error composition characteristics of an airborne retrodirective cross-eye jamming prototype by conducting a thorough analysis of its system architecture and jamming signal generation principles. Additionally, it introduces a vector guidance algorithm incorporating physical constraints to model and assess the combat effectiveness of cross-eye jamming in dynamic operational scenarios. To validate the scientific robustness of the research findings, a comprehensive verification framework is established, integrating numerical simulations and air interface experiments. Through the systematic combination of diverse experimental configurations, this research summarizes and proposes a methodology for analyzing the hardware specifications and combat effectiveness baseline of cross-eye jamming systems.},

  abstract={Although consumer drones have been used in many attacks, besides specific methods such as jamming, very little research has been conducted on systematical methods to counter these drones. In this paper, we develop generic methods to compromise drone position control algorithms in order to make malicious drones deviate from their targets. Taking advantage of existing methods to remotely manipulate drone sensors through cyber or physical attacks (e.g., [1], [2]), we exploited the weaknesses of position estimation and autopilot controller algorithms on consumer drones in the proposed attacks. For compromising drone position control, we first designed two state estimation attacks: a maximum False Data Injection (FDI) attack and a generic FDI attack that compromised the Kalman-Filter-based position estimation (arguably the most popular method). Furthermore, based on the above attacks, we proposed two attacks on autopilot-based navigation, to compromise the actual position of a malicious drone. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first piece of work in this area. Our analysis and simulation results show that the proposed attacks can significantly affect the position estimation and the actual positions of drones. We also proposed potential countermeasures to address these attacks.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications are vulnerable to smart attacks, where the attacker can change the attack mode (e.g., eavesdropping and jamming) via smart radio devices. To ensure secure transmissions against hybrid attacks, UAVs may transmit confidential information and misleading information alternately. In this paper, we consider a dynamic anti-hybrid attack framework with trajectory optimization, where both a UAV and an attacker attempt to find their optimal trajectories without knowing the information type and the attack mode of each other. Given the major challenge due to incomplete knowledge (i.e., each agent knows only its own information), we establish an adversarial game with partial-observation feature to formulate an optimization problem, and propose a counterfactual regret minimization learning scheme to achieve the correlated equilibrium for both the UAV and attacker. Simulation results validate the superiority of our scheme over a benchmark in UAV communication scenarios with partial information.},

  abstract={Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) navigation is crucial in the operation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). GNSS signals are susceptible to jamming due to their low received power, and vulnerable to spoofing because the civilian signals are typically unencrypted. In addition, multipath and urban canyons can degrade positioning accuracy. An alternative to GNSS in the event that it is unavailable is desirable. Terrestrial cellular signals are a promising option to use for navigation because they are continuously transmitted at higher power levels. Optimizing hardware size, weight, and power (SWaP) is critical for UAVs to maximize endurance, payload capacity, and operational effi-ciency. This paper develops a technique to measure a differential pseudorange between an LTE cell tower and a mobile receiver using a low-SWaP, low-cost software defined radio. This paper also implements an extended Kalman filter to fuse differential pseudorange and inertial measurement unit (IMU) measurements to estimate the trajectory of the mobile receiver. This approach was validated through a flight test with 8.03 m root mean square error (RMSE) on the estimated trajectory.},

  abstract={This paper addresses the critical challenge of achieving precise localization and cooperative control in UAV formation flight under conditions of limited communication and significant electromagnetic interference. The primary objective is to develop and validate a robust computational model and algorithm that ensure accurate UAV positioning while minimizing electromagnetic emissions to enhance anti-jamming capabilities. The proposed model leverages passive bearing-only localization methods, utilizing directional information from neighboring UAVs to determine positions accurately. This approach reduces the need for active signal transmissions, thereby maintaining electromagnetic silence and mitigating the risks associated with jamming and interception. Key components of the model include azimuth angle calculations and the classification of various positioning scenarios within circular UAV formations. Tailored strategies are developed for each scenario, focusing on maintaining the geometric stability of the UAV formation and optimizing position adjustments. Simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods by analyzing positioning errors under different geometric configurations. The results demonstrate that the model significantly improves operational efficiency and positioning accuracy in constrained communication environments. By integrating these methodologies into practical UAV systems, the study aims to enhance the overall effectiveness and reliability of UAV deployments in a wide range of challenging environments, contributing to the broader field of UAV navigation and control.},

  abstract={The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in Internet-of-Things (IoT) has grown, but security for UAV communications still a challenge due to the distributed nature of line-of-sight communication networks. This paper analyses the security issues for UAV-assisted MEC systems, in which UAVs are used to support base stations (BSs) in computing offloaded workloads while also operate as jammers to inhibit malicious eavesdroppers. In this paper, a minimum secure computing capacity maximization issues is addressed by jointly optimizing communication link, computation resources, and UAVs trajectories. These issues are of a non-trivial nature and present a significant challenge to be resolved due to the presence of highly coupled variables. In order to effectively overcome these issues, we introduced the concept of WEB 3.0. Firstly, we introduced blockchain method to enhance security to the UAV assisted MEC system and then to train the data locally and to solve various wireless schemes problems, respectively we proposed a FL method. To contribute to the literature, we developed an effective resource allocation strategy that maximizes computational offloading using WEB 3.0, a Blockchain-based FRL method. Finally, numerical findings indicate that the suggested techniques improve the security computation capacity efficiency of the systems when compared to the standards.},

  abstract={The AUTOLAND project main objective was the development of solutions that can enable the autonomous landing of a fixed-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) on a Fast Patrol Boat (FPB). Since we are operating in a military environment where jamming is possible, we have developed Computer Vision (CV) based systems without using any external sensor information. We have developed and tested two different CV approaches: (i) airborne, and (ii) ground-based. In the airborne approach, the UAV uses its camera and external markers to estimate the relative pose to the landing area and automatically calculates the needed landing trajectory. In the ground-based approach, a ground-based monocular vision system obtains the relative pose of the UAV concerning the camera reference frame using its Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model. Then, a Ground Control Station (GCS) calculates the landing trajectory and transmits it to the UAV. The obtained error was compatible with the automatic landing requirements. The future work will focus on real data acquisition to improve the developed algorithms.},

  abstract={In view of the scarce spectrum resources and inconvenient deployment in wireless communications, this work focuses on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system where a UAV deployed as a base station serves two users by NOMA. A joint power allocation and aerial jamming (PAAJ) scheme is proposed to achieve reliable and secure communications for the system in the presence of a malicious eavesdropper. To be specific, dynamic power allocation is adopted to ensure the reliability of the system and another friendly UAV jammer is introduced to improve the security of the system. The closed-form expressions of connection outage probability (COP), secrecy outage probability (SOP), and effective secrecy throughput (EST) are derived to evaluate the performance of the security-required user in the practical condition of probabilistic line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) air-to-ground (A2G) channels. Moreover, the asymptotic EST is analyzed to obtain further insights. Numerical results show the validity of theoretical derivations and the superiority of the proposed PAAJ scheme over benchmark schemes. The EST of the UAV-enabled NOMA communication system outperforms the conventional terrestrial NOMA system at the low transmitting power from the UAV base station. There exists an optimal height of the UAV base station to maximize the EST, which provides a useful framework for designing UAV-enabled communication systems with heterogeneous service requirements.},

  abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networking and collaboration have significant prospects in both civilian and military applications, due to its remarkable properties in cooperative efficiency, reduced risks, and operational cost. Traditional algorithms have challenging issues of high computational complexity and low efficiency in UAV swarm networking and collaboration, while computational intelligence (CI) has attracted increasing attention since it has advantages in solving complex optimization problems. The networking of UAV swarms serves as an essential foundation for collaboration, and intelligent collaboration is a crucial means of enhancing the performance of UAV swarm systems. To date, extensive CI-based algorithms have been proposed to improve the networking and collaboration capabilities of UAV swarms, and several relevant surveys have also been presented. However, existing surveys either review networking or collaboration. To the best of our knowledge, there is no survey that simultaneously concentrates on CI-based UAV swarm networking and collaboration. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of CI-based networking and collaboration algorithms from six typical aspects including channel access, network routing, cooperative task assignment, cooperative path planning, cooperative search, and cooperative jamming. More importantly, to help researchers choose appropriate algorithms to satisfy the requirements of different missions, we classify CI-based algorithms into four categories, namely heuristic behavior search-based algorithms, policy design-based algorithms, policy learning-based algorithms, and hybrid algorithms. Finally, we discuss open issues and future directions that may influence future research on UAV swarm intelligence networking and collaboration. This review may provide new insights and valuable references for researchers in this field.},

  abstract={An attack on a drone is a technique used to stop or obstruct the drone's working system. These attacks can also be used to determine security vulnerabilities to drones.

  abstract={Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) allows multiple users to share link resource for higher spectrum efficiency. It can be applied to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and mobile edge computing (MEC) networks to provide convenient offloading computing service for ground users (GUs) with large-scale access. However, due to the line-of-sight (LoS) of UAV transmission, the information can be easily eavesdropped in NOMA-based UAV-MEC networks. In this paper, we propose a secure communication scheme for the NOMA-based UAV-MEC system towards a flying eavesdropper. In the proposed scheme, the average security computation capacity of the system is maximized while guaranteeing a minimum security computation requirement for each GU. Due to the uncertainty of the eavesdropper’s position, the coupling of multi-variables and the non-convexity of the problem, we first study the worst security situation through mathematical derivation. Then, the problem is solved by utilizing successive convex approximation (SCA) and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods with respect to channel coefficient, transmit power, central processing unit (CPU) computation frequency, local computation and UAV trajectory. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme is superior to the benchmarks in terms of the system security computation performance.},

  abstract={In recent years, due to the rapid development of UAV, numerous UA V black flying incidents have occurred, bringing many threats such as security and privacy infringement. Therefore, it is imperative to develop anti-UAV measures. This paper proposes a distributed interference source forwarding deception jamming method (DISJM) based on spatial domain to address the problems of strict limitations on the interference location of traditional single interference sources, easy detection by signal arrival angle detection modules, and poor interference concealment. This method eliminates strict limitations on the location of interference sources by placing them on concentric circles with inverted cones as the vertices in important places such as airports and large-scale events, and suspending them in the stratosphere, allowing for flexible station deployment. And by identifying and locating the target UAV, utilizing the location information of distributed interference sources, the airspace is divided to achieve the forwarding of complete constellation deception signals. The simulation results show that the distributed forwarding deception interference method based on spatial domain can accurately achieve delay control, achieve multi-domain fusion of forwarding deception signals in time-frequency domain, power domain, and spatial domain, successfully deceive the target UAV to the preset position, protect important areas, and effectively improve the concealment and interference success rate of deception interference signals.},

  abstract={With the development of society, the development of communication technology has entered a new stage, and it is playing an increasingly important role in people's lives and has become an indispensable part. At the same time, the research direction of communication technology is also changing, among which the research of emergency communication has become one of the most important research directions. Aiming at the problem that the existing synchronization algorithms have a high probability of missing detection in the fast time-varying UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) channel, this paper proposes a channel estimation-based optimization method for UAV communication link performance. According to the energy change in the sliding window, the position of each path is judged, and then the first path is detected by threshold method or adaptive threshold method. Using GPS positioning information to accurately calculate the minimum mean square, maximum signal-to-noise ratio and minimum variance, and according to the optimal selection criterion, the complex anti-jamming signals can be weakened and eliminated. Finally, through the ground test and air-to-ground test, the UAV data link system is tested by corresponding examples, and the corresponding improvements are made according to the test results. The test also shows the practicability and stability of the system.},
